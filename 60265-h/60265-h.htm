<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="cheaderfont"><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place de l’Opera</i></span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">Not long after the beginning of the
war in Europe four American girls
set sail from New York City to
aid in the Red Cross nursing.</p>

<p>When they boarded the “Philadelphia”
they were almost strangers to one another.
And never were girls more unlike.</p>

<p>Eugenia Peabody, the oldest of the four,
hailed from Massachusetts and appeared
almost as stern and forbidding as the rock-bound
coasts. Privately the others insisted
in the early part of their acquaintance that
this same Eugenia must have been born an
“old maid.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[8]</span></p>

<p>Mildred Thornton was the daughter of
a distinguished New York judge and her
mother a prominent society woman. But
Mildred herself cared little for a butterfly
existence. With the call of the suffering
sounding in her ears she had given up a
luxurious existence for the hardships and
perils of a Red Cross nurse.</p>

<p>The youngest of the four girls, Barbara
Meade, was a very small person with a
large store of energy and unexpectedness.
And the last girl, Nona Davis, was a native
of the conservative old city of Charleston,
South Carolina. Although a mystery
shadowed her mother’s history, Nona had
been brought up by her father, a one-time
Confederate general, with all the ideas and
traditions of the old South.</p>

<p>Yet in spite of these contrasts in their
natures and lives, the four American Red
Cross girls had spent more than six months
caring for the wounded British soldiers
in the Sacred Heart Hospital in northern
France.</p>

<p>With the closing of the last story the news
had come that the headquarters of the<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
hospital must be changed at once. At
any hour the German invaders might swarm
into the countryside.</p>

<p>There had been but little time to remove
the wounded. So, not wishing to add to the
responsibilities and finding themselves more
in the way than of service, the four girls
had escaped together to a small town in
France farther away from the enemy’s line.</p>

<p>Here they concluded to offer their aid
to the Croix de Rouge, or the Red Cross
Society of France.</p>

<p>But this was in the spring, and now
another autumn has come round.</p>

<p>One wonders what the four American
girls are doing and where they are living.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The great square in front of the Grand
Opera House in Paris surged with excited
people.</p>

<p>Automobiles and carriages crowded with
men and women, waving tri-colored flags,
filled the streets. It was a warm October
night with a brilliant canopy of stars overhead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[10]</span></p>

<p>“Vive la France! Vive l’Armée!” the
throng shouted, swaying backward and
forward in its effort to draw closer to the
great palace.</p>

<p>There must have been between five and
ten thousand persons in the neighborhood,
for tonight France was celebrating her
greatest achievement of the war. At last
the news had come that the victorious
French army had driven the Germans back
across the frontiers of Alsace-Lorraine.
Once again the French flag was planted
within their lost provinces.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquote0">“Allons, enfants, de la patrie,
</div><div class="indent0">Le jour de gloire est arrivé.”
</div></div></div></div>

<p>In the crowd a woman had started the
singing of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marseillaise</i>. Immediately
thousands of voices joined in the song,
while thousands of feet kept time upon the
paving stones to this greatest of all marching
measures.</p>

<p>Six broad streets in Paris converge into a
triangular square which is known as the
Place de l’Opera. From here one looks
upward to the opera house itself, a splendid<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
building three stories in height and approached
by a broad flight of stone steps.</p>

<p>Standing within the crowd, a little to the
left of the opera, was a group of five persons,
four of them girls, while the fifth was a young
man whose coat was buttoned in such a
fashion that he appeared to have but one
arm. However, the other arm hung limp
and useless underneath his coat.</p>

<p>Although their appearance and accents
were those of foreigners, two of the girls
in the little party were singing along with
the French crowd. The other two were
silent, although their faces expressed equal
interest and animation.</p>

<p>Suddenly the singing of the street crowd
ceased. The central door of the opera house
had been thrown open and a young woman
came out upon the portico. She was dressed
in a clinging white robe and wore upon her
head a diadem of brilliants, while in her
hands she carried the French flag. So
skilfully had the lights been arranged
behind her that she could be seen for a great
distance. To the onlookers she represented
the symbolic female figure of the great<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
French Republic, “Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité.”</p>

<p>For a moment after her appearance there
was a breathless silence, then the next even
more enthusiastic shouts resounded:</p>

<p>“Vive Chenel! Vive Chenel!” Hats
were thrown into the air, thousands of flags
waved, while myriads of handkerchiefs
fluttered like white doves.</p>

<p>It was a night to be always remembered
by the people who shared its rapture.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquote0">“Aux armes, citoyens, formez vos bataillons!
</div><div class="indent0">Marchons! Marchons!”
</div></div></div></div>

<p>With the closing of the final verse of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marseillaise</i>, in the midst of the wild
applause, the smallest of the four girls in the
little group placed her hand gently upon the
armless sleeve of her young man companion.</p>

<p>“Tonight makes up for a good deal,
doesn’t it, Dick?” she queried a little
wistfully. As she spoke her blue eyes were
shining with excitement, while a warm color
flooded her cheeks.</p>

<p>The young fellow nodded. “It is the
greatest spectacle I ever saw and one we<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
shall never forget,” he replied. “Yet there
will be a greater night to come when this
war is finally over, though when that night
will be no one can foretell.”</p>

<p>Dick Thornton spoke gravely and seemed
weary from the evening’s excitement. But
then something of what he had passed
through in the last six months showed in
other ways than in his empty coat sleeve.</p>

<p>Without his knowledge, the girl who had
been speaking continued to study him for
another moment. Then she turned to
Mildred Thornton, who was on her other
side, and whispered:</p>

<p>“Mill, Dick is tired, but would rather
die than confess it. Can’t you think of
some way to get us out of this crowd before
the breaking up begins? The jam then
will be awful and we may not be able to
keep together.”</p>

<p>Up to the instant of Barbara Meade’s
suggestion, Mildred had forgotten all personal
matters in her interest in the music
and the vivid beauty of the scene surrounding
them. Now she too glanced toward her
brother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[14]</span></p>

<p>“Dick,” she suggested at once, “don’t
you think we had best start back toward
our pension? Madame Chenel is to sing an
encore and I’m sorry we must miss it, but I
really think it would be more sensible to
go.”</p>

<p>With the closing of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marseillaise</i> the
celebrated singer had disappeared. Now
in the midst of Mildred’s remark she
returned to the balcony of the Opera House.
No longer was she wearing her crown of
brilliants, nor carrying the immense French
flag. Instead her head was uncovered,
showing her dark hair and eyes and the flag
she bore was British, not French.</p>

<p>Then she began singing in English, but
with a delicious French accent:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquote0">“It’s a long way to Tipperary,
</div><div class="indent1">It’s a long way to go.”
</div></div></div></div>

<p>The crowd joined in the chorus. There
were soldiers on the street, who had returned
to Paris on leaves of absence, after learning
English from the Tommies in the trenches.
Others had only a faint knowledge of a few
English words. But everybody sang, and<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
because some of the voices were French and
others English the effect was all the more
thrilling and amusing.</p>

<p>Naturally Dick hesitated for a moment,
then he remembered his own condition.
Certainly he would be powerless to push
their way through the great throng. Then
if by chance rioting should break out from
sheer excitement, it would be impossible
for him to protect four girls. True, the
American Red Cross girls were fairly well
able to look after themselves in most emergencies.
But Dick Thornton did not like
the idea of having them put to the test at
such a time and under the present circumstances.</p>

<p>“I am afraid you are right, Mildred,” he
agreed reluctantly. “Let’s form a single
file; I’ll go first and all of you follow me.
Tell the others.”</p>

<p>Mildred at once put her arm inside a
young woman’s who was standing near her,
apparently oblivious of the past conversation.
Yet one would have expected Eugenia
Peabody to have been first to have made the
sensible suggestion of the past few moments.<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
Yet it was Barbara Meade with whom it
had actually originated.</p>

<p>But Eugenia too had been swept off her
feet with enthusiasm. Moreover, she could
scarcely make up her mind now to agree
to leave, although plainly appreciating
the situation. Eugenia looked surprisingly
handsome tonight.</p>

<p>In the first place, she wore a new Paris
frock, which after long insistence the other
three girls had persuaded her to buy. It
was an inexpensive dress of dark-blue cloth
and silk, but it was stylishly made and
extremely becoming. Above all, Eugenia
had at last discarded the unattractive hat
in which she had set sail, and which she had
resolutely worn until this day. The new
one had only cost five francs, but one
should see the character of hat that can be
bought in Paris for one dollar!</p>

<p>Eugenia, it is true, had begrudged even
that small amount for her own adornment,
until Nona and Barbara had refused to
appear upon the street with her still in her
ancient “Alpine.” However, although she
rebelled against the unnecessary extravagance,<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
so far Eugenia had not regretted her
purchases.</p>

<p>At the present moment she was standing
next to Nona Davis and turned to speak to
her.</p>

<p>“Nona, I am sorry when it’s all so
wonderful, but we must start back to the
pension at once. Please come on,” she
insisted authoritatively.</p>

<p>And Eugenia had every reason to believe
that Nona heard her words and agreed with
her. She even thought that Nona moved
on a few paces behind her. Moreover,
this is exactly what she did. Nevertheless,
Nona afterwards insisted that her act must
have been purely involuntary, since she was
not conscious of having heard or obeyed
her companion.</p>

<p>If the little group of five Americans had
been enthralled by the night’s excitement,
it was Nona Davis who was most completely
swept off her feet. Never had she even
dreamed of such beauty and glamour as this
gala night in Paris offered!</p>

<p>So little even of her own land had Nona
seen, nothing save Charleston and the<span class="pagenum">[18]</span>
surrounding neighborhood and the view
from her car window on her way to New
York City.</p>

<p>The few days in London had been overhung
with the thought of the work ahead.
But here in Paris for the past week the four
Red Cross girls had been enjoying a brief
holiday and were completely under the
spell of the fascinating and beautiful city.</p>

<p>Upon persons with a far wider experience
of life and places than Nona Davis, Paris
frequently casts this same spell. Indeed,
it sometimes seems impossible that a city
can be so beautiful and yet suited to the
uses of everyday life. Both in Paris and
in Venice one often expects to wake up
and find the city a dream and not a reality.</p>

<p>Certainly Nona had turned automatically
to do as Eugenia had commanded her. But
unfortunately, at the same moment Madame
Chenel finished her English song and began
at once on another which by an odd chance
had a reminiscent quality for Nona. Instinctively
she paused to listen and remember.</p>

<p>Her impression of the song was one of
long ago. Nona’s mother had once been in<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>
New Orleans. Now the vision came to her
daughter of an old-fashioned spinet at one
end of the drawing room in her home in
Charleston, and of a young woman in a
white dress with blue ribbons sitting there
singing this same French verse.</p>

<p>For the moment everything else was
forgotten. The girl simply stood spellbound
until the great artist finished. Only
when she began bowing her thanks to the
applauding crowd, did Nona turn again
to look for Eugenia and her other friends.
But as more than five minutes had passed
since their warning, and as they had believed
Nona following them, no one of the four
could be seen.</p>

<p>Moreover, at this same moment the great
crowd began to break up. Then, as is
always the case, everybody struggled to get
away at the same moment.</p>

<p>Just at first Nona was not alarmed at
finding herself alone; she was simply
bewildered. However, because she was
endeavoring to stand still while every one
else was moving, she was constantly being
shoved from side to side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[20]</span></p>

<p>Her first intention was to remain in the
same place for a few moments. Then Dick
or one of the girls would probably return
for her. However, she soon appreciated
that no human being could push their way
back through the thronging multitude.
Moreover, she too must move along or be
trampled upon.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the fact that she was alone
did not seem to have been observed. For
although the people in her neighborhood
were not rough and ugly, as an English or
Teutonic crowd might have been, nevertheless,
Nona knew that for a young girl to be
alone at night in the streets of Paris was
an unheard-of thing. Besides, later on the
crowd might indulge in noisier ways of
celebrating the German defeat than by
listening to the singing of the great prima
donna.</p>

<p>What had she best do? As she was being
pushed along, Nona was also thinking
rapidly, although somewhat confusedly.
She had not been on the street alone since
her arrival. Both Mildred and Dick Thornton
were familiar with Paris and had been
acting as the others’ escorts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[21]</span></p>

<p>Their little French pension happened to
be over on the other side of Paris. Fortunately,
Nona remembered that she could
find a bus near the Madeleine, the famous
church not more than a dozen blocks away
from the neighborhood of the opera. But
how to reach this destination and what bus
to take after her arrival? These were
problems still to be dealt with. First of all,
she must keep her forlorn condition a secret
from observers in order not to be spoken
to by an impertinent stranger.</p>

<p>Naturally Nona appreciated that it was
impossible for all Frenchmen to be equally
courteous. Therefore, one of them might
misunderstand her present predicament.</p>

<p>However, as there was nothing else to
do she continued moving with the crowd.
In the meantime she kept assuring herself
that it was absurd to be so nervous over an
ordinary adventure. Think what experiences
she had so lately passed through as
a Red Cross nurse!</p>

<p>But if she had only been wearing her
nurse’s uniform, always it served as a
protection! Yet naturally when one was<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
off duty and merely a holiday visitor in a
city, it was pleasanter to dress like other
persons.</p>

<p>Like Eugenia, Nona was also wearing a
new frock. Hers was of black silk with a
hat of black tulle, making her fair hair and
skin more conspicuous by contrast. Certainly
she would be apt to attract attention
among the darker, more vividly colored
French girls.</p>

<p>But Nona had gone half the distance to
the Madeleine before she was annoyed.
Then just as she was about to cross the
street at one of the corners, an arm was
unexpectedly slipped through hers.</p>

<p>With her heart pounding with terror and
every bit of color drained from her cheeks,
Nona looked up into the eyes of an impertinent
youth.</p>

<p>“La belle Americaine!” he announced
insolently.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="cheaderfont"><em>Another Meeting</em></span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">The next instant Nona recovered
her poise. She was, however, both
frightened and angry. Yet if it
were possible to avoid it, she did not wish
to raise an alarm nor create any kind of
commotion upon the street.</p>

<p>At first quietly and firmly she attempted
removing her arm, at the same time regarding
the Frenchman with an expression of
scorn and disapproval.</p>

<p>“Let me go at once,” she said, speaking
excellent French, so there was no possibility
of being misunderstood.</p>

<p>But the young man only shrugged his
shoulders, looking, if she had but known it,
more mischievous than wicked.</p>

<p>But Nona was now gazing despairingly
about her. There were numbers of persons
near by, stout mothers and fathers,
the respectable tradespeople of Paris, with<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
the usual French family of two children.
Nona could, of course, appeal to any one of
them. But just at the instant no one was
sufficiently near to accost without raising
her voice. This would, of course, attract
public attention, which, if possible, Nona
did not wish to do.</p>

<p>So she waited another second, hoping
her tormentor would release her of his own
accord. Finding he did not intend this,
she glanced about for assistance a second
time. Then she discovered two young
officers passing within a few feet of her.
One of them wore a British uniform and
the other French.</p>

<p>Nona spoke quickly, knowing instinctively
that the men were gentlemen.</p>

<p>“Stop a moment, please!” she asked.
“I am a stranger and have lost my friends
in the crowd. This man is annoying me.”</p>

<p>Then in spite of her efforts the girl’s
voice shook with nervousness while her eyes
filled with humiliated tears.</p>

<p>With her first words the two officers
whirled around. At the same moment
Nona’s persecutor started to run. However,<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>
he was not quick enough, for the
young French officer managed to slip his
scabbard between the fellow’s feet. At
once he was face down on the ground and
only brought upright again by the officer’s
hand on his collar.</p>

<p>In the interval the other young man was
gazing at Nona Davis in surprise and perhaps
with something like pleasure.</p>

<p>“Miss Davis,” he began, lifting his
officer’s cap formally, “are we never to
meet except under extraordinary circumstances?
You may not remember me, but
I am Lieutenant Hume, Colonel Dalton’s
aide. Perhaps you recall that unfortunate
affair in which Miss Thornton was concerned
at the Sacred Heart Hospital? But
before that you know there was our first
meeting at the gardener’s cottage in Surrey.”</p>

<p>It was unnecessary for Lieutenant Hume
to present Nona with all his credentials of
acquaintance. For at this instant she was
too unreservedly glad to see him. To
have discovered some one whom she knew
at such a trying time was an unexpected
boon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[26]</span></p>

<p>“I am, you see&mdash;oh, I can’t explain now,”
Nona protested. “But, Lieutenant Hume,
if you have nothing very important to do,
won’t you be kind enough to put me on
the right bus. I am trying to get back to
our pension. And though I am sorry to be
so stupid, I am lost and dreadfully frightened.”</p>

<p>The hand that Nona now extended to
her English acquaintance was cold with
nervousness.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Hume took it and bowed
courteously. “Of course I will take you
home with the greatest pleasure,” he returned.
At the same time he smiled to
himself:</p>

<p>“Girls are indeed strange creatures, say
what you will! Here is a young American
girl who has been doing Red Cross work
near the battlefield. She has been able to
keep her head and remain cool and collected
among war’s horrors, but because she has
been spoken to on the street by a young
ruffian she is terrified and confused.”
Possibly she would have scorned his protection
in the face of an artillery charge, when<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>
under the present conditions a masculine
protector was fairly useful.</p>

<p>Now for the first time the young French
officer spoke. He had just given his captive
a rough shake and then straightened
him up again after a second attempt to get
away.</p>

<p>“What shall I do with this fellow, Mademoiselle?”
he asked, speaking English with
difficulty, but showing extraordinarily white,
even teeth under a small, dark moustache.
Indeed, Nona decided that she had never
seen a more charming and debonair figure
than the young French officer, when he
finally engaged her attention. He could
scarcely have been more than five feet,
four inches tall, yet his figure was perfectly
built. He was slender, but from the casual
fashion in which he gripped the other man,
who was several inches taller and far
heavier, he must have been extraordinarily
strong.</p>

<p>“Oh, let the man go, please,” Nona murmured
weakly. “Yes, I know I should
have you turn him over to a gendarme and
appear against him in court, but really I
should hate doing it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[28]</span></p>

<p>The girl smiled at the young French
officer’s evident disappointment. He made
no protest, however; only he gave the
man another half-savage shake and said
rapidly in French:</p>

<p>“Why aren’t you with the army, you
miserable loafer? Your name at once?”
Then, when the offender mumbled something
indistinguishable: “Report to me
at the barracks tomorrow. Oh, I shall
find you again, never fear, and it will then
be imprisonment for you.”</p>

<p>The moment after the man had run away
the French officer stood at attention with
his shoulders erect and his feet together.
The next he bowed to Nona in an exquisitely
correct fashion, as Lieutenant Hume
introduced him.</p>

<p>“Miss Davis, my friend, Captain Henri
Castaigne, one of the youngest captains in
the French army.” Lieutenant Hume then
added boyishly: “Tomorrow he is to be
presented with the Cross of the Legion of
Honor.”</p>

<p>Nona was naturally impressed by such
an introduction. But evidently the young<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>
officer preferred not having his praises
sung to a complete stranger. He pretended
not even to have heard his friend’s last
remark.</p>

<p>“I will say au revoir,” he returned graciously.
“Since you and Lieutenant Hume
are old acquaintances, he will prefer to take
you to your friends unaccompanied by me.”</p>

<p>He was about to withdraw when Nona
interposed.</p>

<p>“But you must have had some engagement
together for the evening. Now if
you separate on my account your evening
will be spoiled. So please don’t trouble
to take me all the way to the pension; just
find my omnibus and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Both young men laughed. The idea of
leaving a girl alone in such an extremity
was of course an absurdity.</p>

<p>“Oh, come along, Henri, Miss Davis will
be able to endure your society for a few
moments as long as I was braced to endure
it all evening.” Lieutenant Hume added:
“Besides, it may help your education to
talk to an American girl. Castaigne does
not know a thing except military tactics;<span class="pagenum">[30]</span>
he is rather a duffer,” the English officer
continued half proudly and half with a
pretense of contempt. It was not difficult
to discover that there was a good deal of
affection existing between the two young
officers of the Allied armies.</p>

<p>Nona wondered how they happened to
know each other so intimately.</p>

<p>“By the way, Lieutenant Hume,” she
asked, when they had finally reached the
desired square and stood waiting their turn
on the overcrowded omnibus. “How in
the world do you chance to be in Paris
instead of at the front? The last time I
heard of you, you were in the midst of
desperate fighting.”</p>

<p>The young man answered so quietly
that no one except his two companions
could hear. “I am in Paris on a private
mission for the British Government. I
am not at liberty to say anything more.”</p>

<p>Nona flushed, a little confused at having
appeared to be curious when she had only
meant to be friendly. But immediately
Lieutenant Hume inquired:</p>

<p>“May I ask the same question of you?<span class="pagenum">[31]</span>
How do you chance to be in Paris? Did
you come here after the Sacred Heart Hospital
was closed? I knew that one side of
it had been struck by a shell and partly
destroyed.”</p>

<p>Nona nodded. “Yes, but let us not talk
of that now, if you don’t mind. We had to
move the wounded soldiers, the supplies
and everything in a tremendous hurry.
So we are resting now for a short time and
afterwards mean to go into southern France
to help with the hospital work there. But
hasn’t tonight’s celebration been too wonderful?
It is the very first victory I have
ever helped to celebrate and it has made
me very happy.”</p>

<p>“Then you are not entirely neutral, as
you Americans are supposed to be?” Lieutenant
Hume queried, waiting with more
interest than was natural for his companion’s
reply. “I thought Red Cross
doctors and nurses were expected to have
no feeling about the war.”</p>

<p>Nona hesitated. “Of course, that is true
so far as our nursing goes,” she replied.
“Naturally I would nurse any soldier without<span class="pagenum">[32]</span>
its making the least difference what his
nationality might be. But when it comes
to a question of my own personal feeling,
well, that is a different matter.”</p>

<p>Nona’s answer was a little incoherent;
nevertheless, her companion seemed to find
it satisfactory.</p>

<p>On arriving at the pension Eugenia herself
opened the door. The concierge had
previously admitted the girl and her two
escorts to the ground floor.</p>

<p>The apartment where the four girls and
Dick Thornton were at present boarding
occupied the third floor of an old house
that had once belonged to an ancient
French family and had afterwards been
converted into an apartment building. Such
houses are common in Paris. The atmosphere
of this one was gloomy and imposing
and the hallway very dark.</p>

<p>At first Eugenia only saw Nona outside
or she might have been more amiable.
However, she had been so frightened for
the past hour that she was thoroughly
angry, an effect fright often has upon
people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[33]</span></p>

<p>“Nona, what does this mean?” she demanded,
speaking like an outraged school-marm.
“You have given us one of the
worst hours any one of us has ever spent.
Why did you not come along with the rest
of us? Of course, no one wished to leave;
it was quite as much of a sacrifice for us
as for you. Now Mildred and Barbara
and Dick have had to go back to look for
you and to inform the police of your disappearance.
I have waited here, hoping for
a message from them or you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. I am dreadfully sorry,”
Nona replied more apologetically than she
actually felt. Naturally regretting the
trouble she had given, yet she did not enjoy
being scolded before entire strangers.</p>

<p>“Eugenia,” she protested, changing the
tone of her voice in an effort to stem the
tide of her friend’s resentment, “I was so
fortunate as to meet Lieutenant Hume on
the street. You may recall he was Colonel
Dalton’s companion when he visited the
Sacred Heart Hospital. He and his friend
have been good enough to bring me home.
I should like to have you meet them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[34]</span></p>

<p>Certainly Eugenia was somewhat nonplussed
on discovering that there had been
an audience to overhear her reproaches.
Still she was no less offended. However,
she could not exactly make up her mind to
refuse to be introduced to Nona’s acquaintances,
who had undoubtedly been kind.</p>

<p>The result was that she was stiffer and
colder than ever before as she stalked
ahead into the pension drawing room,
leaving the younger girl and the two men
to follow her.</p>

<p>Moreover, Eugenia undoubtedly looked
plain, partly as the result of her severe
mood and partly of her fatigue and anxiety.
She had removed her street suit and was
wearing a gray frock that might have been
cut out by the village carpenter, so free was
it from any possible grace or prettiness.
The dress had been intended to be useful
and undoubtedly had been, for Eugenia
must have been wearing it for the past five
years.</p>

<p>But Eugenia really believed that she was
fairly gracious to the two young officers.
She shook hands with both of them and<span class="pagenum">[35]</span>
asked them to be seated. She even thanked
them for escorting the scapegrace home, yet
all in a manner that suggested ice trying
to thaw on an impossibly cold day.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Hume paid but little attention
to her, being frankly too much interested
in Nona Davis to do more than be
polite to Miss Peabody, whom he regarded
strictly in the light of a chaperon.</p>

<p>But to Captain Castaigne Eugenia was
at once a puzzle and an amusement. In
his life he had never seen any one in the
least like her.</p>

<p>The young French officer belonged to an
old and aristocratic French family. Had
France remained a monarchy instead of
becoming a republic, he would have held
a distinguished title. He was not a native
of Paris, for he had been brought up in the
country with his mother upon their impoverished
estate. Later, as she considered
a soldier’s life the only one possible
for her son, he had attended a military
school for officers. So it was true that he
knew but little of women. However, those
he had met previously had been his mother’s<span class="pagenum">[36]</span>
friends and their daughters. They were
women with charming, gracious manners,
of unusual culture and refinement. Moreover,
they had always been extremely kind
to him. Now this remarkable young
American woman paid no more attention
to him than if he had been a wooden figure,
and perhaps not so much. Her appearance
and manner recalled an officer whom
he had once had as a teacher. His colonel
had been just such a tall, stern person, who
having given his orders expected them to
be obeyed without demur. So the young
French officer was torn between his desire
to laugh, which of course his perfect
manners made impossible, and his desire
to offer this Miss Peabody a military
salute.</p>

<p>She spoke the most extraordinary French
he had ever heard in his life. Her grammar
was possibly correct, but such another
accent had never been listened to on sea or
land. Captain Castaigne was not familiar
with Americans, so how could he know
that Eugenia spoke French with a Boston
intonation?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[37]</span></p>

<p>Ten, fifteen minutes elapsed, while conversation
between Eugenia and the French
officer became more and more impossible.
Nevertheless his friend failed to regard
Captain Castaigne’s imploring glances.</p>

<p>At last the English officer realized that
their call was becoming unduly long under
the circumstances. Yet before saying farewell
he managed a few moments of confidential
conversation with Nona.</p>

<p>“You will persuade your friends to come
to the Review tomorrow? I shall call for
you more than an hour ahead of time.
President Poincaré himself is to present
decorations to a dozen soldiers. I say it
would be rotten for you to miss it.”</p>

<p>Undoubtedly Nona agreed with him.
“You are awfully kind. I accept for us
all with pleasure and shall look forward
then to tomorrow,” she returned. “Thank
you again for tonight, and good-by.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="cheaderfont"><em>The Cross of the Legion of Honor</em></span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">That night just before falling asleep
Nona Davis had an unexpected
flash of thought. It was odd that
Lieutenant Hume, who had been a friend
in need, should turn out to be such a well-educated
and attractive fellow. Moreover,
how did it happen that he was a
British officer? Now and then for some
especial act of valor, or for some especial
ability, a man was raised from the ranks.
Yet Nona did not believe either of these
things to have happened in Lieutenant
Hume’s case.</p>

<p>What was the answer to the puzzle?
He was the son of a gardener and she herself
had seen his mother Susan, a comfortable
old lady with twinkling brown
eyes, red cheeks, a large bosom and a round
waist to match. Surely it was difficult to
conceive of <em>her</em> as the mother of such a son!<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>
And especially in England where it was so
difficult to rise above one’s environment.</p>

<p>Although tired and sleepy, Nona devoted
another ten minutes to her riddle. Then
all at once the answer appeared plain
enough. Lieutenant Hume had doubtless
been brought up as the foster brother of a
boy of nobler birth and greater riches than
he himself possessed. Then, doubtless,
seeing his unusual abilities, he had been
given unusual opportunities. Nona had
read English novels in which just such
interesting situations occurred, so she felt
rather pleased with her own discernment.
However, if it were possible to introduce
the subject without being rude, she intended
to make sure of her impression by questioning
Lieutenant Hume. One might so
easily begin by discussing English literature,
a subject certainly broad enough in
itself. Then one could mention a particular
book, where a foster brother played a
conspicuous part. But while trying to
recall a story with just the exact situation
she required, Nona went to sleep.</p>

<p>She and Barbara shared the same room.<span class="pagenum">[40]</span>
But fortunately no one of her other friends
had been so severe as Eugenia. However,
after the departure of the two young men,
realizing that she had been tiresome, Nona
had been sufficiently contrite to appease
even Eugenia.</p>

<p>The next morning at <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">déjeuner</i> Dick Thornton
declared that Nona’s adventure had
really resulted in good fortune for all of
them. More than most things he had
desired to attend the review of the fresh
troops about to leave Paris for the firing
line. Moreover, it would be uncommonly
interesting to see the presentation of the
decorations by the French President. And
if Nona had not chanced to meet Lieutenant
Hume and his friend, neither of
these opportunities would have been theirs.
Dick had no chance of securing the special
invitations and tickets necessary for seats
in the reviewing stand. Privately Dick
had intended escaping from the four girls
to witness the scene alone. But now as
Lieutenant Hume had invited all of them
it would be unnecessary to make this confession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[41]</span></p>

<p>The review was to take place on a level
stretch of country just outside Paris between
St. Cloud and the Bois.</p>

<p>Having in some magical fashion secured
two antiquated taxicabs, Lieutenant Hume
arrived next day at the pension. He and
Nona and Eugenia started off in one of
them, with Barbara, Mildred and Dick in
the other.</p>

<p>During the ride into the country Lieutenant
Hume talked the greater part of the
time about his friend, Captain Castaigne,
whom Nona and Eugenia had met the evening
before. The two men had only known
each other since the outbreak of the war,
yet a devoted friendship had developed
between them.</p>

<p>Indeed, Nona smiled to herself over
Lieutenant Hume’s enthusiasm; it was so
unlike an Englishman to reveal such deep
feeling. But for the time being Captain
Henri Castaigne was one of the idols of
Paris. The day’s newspapers were full of
the gallant deed that had won him the
right to the military order France holds
most dear, “The Cross of the Legion of
Honor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[42]</span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, during the early part of
the conversation Eugenia scarcely listened.
She was too busily and happily engaged in
watching the sights about her. Paris was
having a curious effect upon the New England
girl, one that she did not exactly understand.
She was both shocked and fascinated
by it.</p>

<p>In the first place, she had not anticipated
liking Paris. She had only consented
to make the trip because they were
in need of rest and the other girls had
chosen Paris. Everything she had ever
heard or read concerning Paris had made
her feel prejudiced against the city. Moreover,
it was totally unlike Eastport, Massachusetts,
where Eugenia had been born and
bred and where she had received most of
her ideas of life.</p>

<p>Yet there was no denying that there was
something about Paris that took hold even
of Eugenia Peabody’s repressed imagination.</p>

<p>It was a brilliant autumn afternoon.
The taxicab rattled along the Champs
Elysées, under the marvelous Arc de Triomphe<span class="pagenum">[43]</span>
and then turned into the wooded
spaces of the Bois.</p>

<p>Every now and then Eugenia found a
lump rising in her throat and her heart
beating curiously fast. It was all so beautiful,
both in art and nature. Surely it was
impossible to believe that there could be
an enemy mad enough to destroy a city
that could never be restored to its former
loveliness.</p>

<p>Perchance the war had purified Paris,
taking away its uglier side in the healing
influence of patriotism. For even Eugenia’s
New England eyes and conscience could
find but little to criticize. Naturally many
of the costumes worn by the young women
she considered reprehensible. The colors
were too bright, the skirts were too short.
French women were really too stylish for
her severer tastes. For there was little
black to be seen. This was a gala afternoon,
so whatever one’s personal sorrow,
today Paris honored the living.</p>

<p>Before Eugenia consented to listen Lieutenant
Hume had arrived in the middle of
his story, and then she listened only half-heartedly.<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>
She was interested chiefly because
the young Captain she had met the
evening before was so far from one’s idea
of a hero. He was more like a figure of a
manikin dressed to represent an officer and
set up in a shop window. His features
were too perfect, he was too graceful, too
debonair! But in truth Eugenia’s idea of
a soldier must still have been represented
by the type of man who, shouldering a
musket and still in his farmer’s clothes,
marched out to meet the enemy at Bunker
Hill.</p>

<p>Some day Eugenia would learn that it
takes all manner of men and women to
make a world. And that there are worthwhile
people and things that do not come
from Boston.</p>

<p>“He was in the face of the enemy’s fire
when a shell exploded under his horse,”
Lieutenant Hume explained. “He and the
horse were shot twenty feet in the air.
When they came down to earth again there
was an immense hole in the ground beneath
them and both man and horse were plunged
into it. Rather like having one’s grave
dug ahead of time, isn’t it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[45]</span></p>

<p>Nona nodded, leaning across from her
seat in the cab with her golden brown eyes
darkening with excitement and her hands
clasped tight together in her lap.</p>

<p>Eugenia kept her eyes upon her even
while giving her attention to the narrative.
Personally she considered Nona unusually
pretty and attractive and the idea worried
her now and then. For there were to be no
romances if she could prevent them while
the four American Red Cross girls were in
Europe. If they wished such undesirable
possessions as husbands they must wait and
marry their own countrymen.</p>

<p>“But Captain Castaigne was not hurt?
So he still managed to carry the messages
to his General?” Nona demanded. She
was much interested in getting the details
of the story before seeing its hero again.</p>

<p>Robert Hume was talking quietly. Nevertheless
it was self-evident that he was only
pretending to his casual tone.</p>

<p>“Of course Captain Castaigne was injured.
There would have been no reason
why any notice should have been taken of
him if he had only done his ordinary duty.<span class="pagenum">[46]</span>
Fact is, when he crawled out he was covered
with blood and nearly dead. The horse
was killed outright and Henri almost so.
Nevertheless he managed to run on foot
under heavy fire to headquarters with his
message. No one knows how he accomplished
it and he knows least of all. He
simply is the kind of fellow who does the
thing he starts out to do. We Anglo-Saxons
don’t always understand the iron
purpose under the charm and good looks
these French fellows have. But fortunately
we don’t often use cavalrymen now for
carrying despatches. Motor cars do the
work better when there is no telephone
connection.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I’m truly glad,” Nona murmured
softly. She was thinking of how
many gallant young cavalry officers both
in France and England those first terrible
months of the war had cut down, before the
lessons of the new warfare had been learned.</p>

<p>But Eugenia had now awakened to a
slight interest in the conversation.</p>

<p>“Your young friend looks fit enough
now,” she remarked dryly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[47]</span></p>

<p>The English officer was not pleased with
Eugenia’s tone. “Nevertheless, Captain
Castaigne has been dangerously ill in a hospital
for many months, although he is returning
to his regiment tomorrow.”</p>

<p>After this speech there was no further
opportunity for conversation. The two
cabs had driven through the Bois and were
now in sight of the field where the review
was to be held.</p>

<p>Drawn up at the left were two new regiments
about to depart for the front. Most
of the soldiers were boys of nineteen who
would have finished their terms of military
service in the following year, but because
of necessity were answering France’s call
today. They were wearing the new French
uniform of gray, which is made for real
service, and not the old-fashioned one with
the dark-blue coat and crimson trousers.
These too often formed conspicuous targets
for the enemy’s guns.</p>

<p>Across from the recruits stood another line
of about fifty men. They were old men
with gray hair. If their shoulders were
still erect and their heads up it was not<span class="pagenum">[48]</span>
because this was now their familiar carriage.
It was because this great day had
inspired them. For they were the old
soldiers who had been gallant fighters in
1870, when France had fought her other
war with Germany. Now they were too old
to be sent to the firing line. Nevertheless,
each one of them was privately armed and
ready to defend his beloved Paris to the
last gasp should the enemy again come to
possess it.</p>

<p>Between the two lines and on horseback
were President Poincaré, France’s new war
minister and half a dozen other members of
the Cabinet.</p>

<p>Then standing in a small group separated
from the others were the soldiers who were
about to be decorated for especial bravery.</p>

<p>While Lieutenant Hume was struggling
to find places for his guests, Nona was
vainly endeavoring to discover the young
French officer whom she had met so unexpectedly
the evening before. She was
anxious to point him out to Mildred and
Dick and Barbara.</p>

<p>But after they were seated it was Eugenia<span class="pagenum">[49]</span>
who found him first. Captain Castaigne
was wearing an ordinary service uniform
with no other decorations besides the emblems
of his rank.</p>

<p>Then a few moments later President
Poincaré and his staff dismounted.</p>

<p>The four American girls were distinctly
disappointed by the French President’s
appearance. He is a small, stout man with
a beard, very middle class and uninteresting
looking. Yet he has managed to hold
France together in times of peace and of
war.</p>

<p>This was indeed a great day for Paris.
Rarely are medals for bravery bestowed
upon the soldiers save near the scene of
battle by the officers in command. Yet
there was little noise and shouting among
the crowd as there had been the evening
before. They were unusually silent, the
women and girls not trying now to keep
back the tears.</p>

<p>Sixty-four buglers sounded a salute.
Then President Poincaré marched forward
and shook hands with every soldier in the
group of twelve. Eleven of them were to<span class="pagenum">[50]</span>
receive the new French decoration which is
known as the “Croix de Guerre.” This is
a medal formed of two crossed swords and
having a profile of a figure representing
the French Republic in the center. But
Captain Castaigne alone was to be honored
with the Cross of the Legion of Honor.</p>

<p>First President Poincaré pinned the
medal on the breast of a boy sentry. He
had stood at the mouth of a trench as the
Germans approached, and though wounded
in half a dozen places had continued to fire
until his companions had been warned of
the attack.</p>

<p>Then one after the other each soldier received
his country’s thanks and the recognition
of his especial bravery until at
length President Poincaré came to young
Captain Castaigne.</p>

<p>One does not know exactly what it was
in the young man’s appearance that touched
the older man. Perhaps when you learn
to know more of his character you will be
better able to understand. For after the
President had bestowed the higher decoration
upon the young captain, he leaned
over and kissed him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[51]</span></p>

<p>Eugenia Peabody had an excellent view
of the entire proceeding. Though her lips
curled sarcastically, strangely enough her
eyes felt absurdly misty. She much disliked
this French custom of the men kissing
each other, for Eugenia believed very
little in kissing between either men or
women. Nevertheless, she did feel disturbed
by the whole performance, and
hoped that her friends were too much engaged
to pay attention to her. Above all
things Eugenia desired that Barbara Meade
should not observe her weakness. She
knew Barbara would never grow weary
hereafter of referring to the amazement of
Eugenia’s giving way to tears in public
and without any possible excuse.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the review began with
a blare of trumpets. Then gravely the
new regiments passed before the President
and his officers. Afterwards they
marched away until a cloud of dust hid them
and there was nothing for the spectators
to do but return to their own homes.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the young French Captain
managed to make his way to his English<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>
friend. He appeared as indifferent and as
debonair as he had the evening before.
One could never have guessed that he had
just received the greatest honor of his life,
and an honor given to but few men.</p>

<p>Reference to his decoration he pretended
not to be able to understand, although
Mildred, Barbara and Dick tried to compliment
him with their best school French.</p>

<p>But beyond inclining her head frostily,
Eugenia made no attempt at a further
acquaintance with the young soldier.</p>

<p>However, several times when he believed
no one was observing him, Captain Castaigne
stole a furtive glance at Eugenia.</p>

<p>She was somewhat better looking than
she had been the evening before, yet she
was by no means a beauty. Moreover,
she was still a puzzle.</p>

<p>Then the boy&mdash;for after all he was only
twenty-three&mdash;swallowed a laugh. At last
he had found a real place for Eugenia. No
wonder he had thought of his former
colonel. Recently he had learned that a
regiment of women in Paris were in training
as soldiers. He could readily behold
Eugenia in command.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[53]</span></p>

<p>The other three American girls were
charming and he was glad to have met
them. But Eugenia he trusted he might
never see again. He was glad to be returning
to the firing line next day. Let heaven
preserve him from further acquaintance
with such an unattractive person!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="cheaderfont"><em>On the Roof</em></span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">One week longer the American Red
Cross girls remained in Paris. They
were only tourists for these brief,
passing days. Yet all the while they were
waiting for orders. After having nursed
the British soldiers for a number of months,
when the Sacred Heart Hospital was no
longer in existence, they had concluded
to offer their services to France.</p>

<p>Therefore, like soldiers, they also were
ready upon short notice to start for the
front. But in the meantime there was
Paris to be investigated, where the October
days were like jewels. One saw all that it
was humanly possible to see of pictures
and people and parks and then came home
to dream of the statues in the Luxembourg,
or of Venus in her shaded corner in the
Louvre, or else of the figure of Victory midway
up the Louvre’s central staircase.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[55]</span></p>

<p>To one another the girls confessed that
it was difficult to think of war so near at
hand, or of the experiences through which
they had so lately passed. Yet one saw the
streets full of soldiers and knew that a great
line of fortifications encircled Paris, such as
few cities have ever had in the world’s
history. Also, there were always guns
mounted on high towers waiting for the
coming of the Zeppelin raid.</p>

<p>“Then one night, as luck would have it,”
Barbara insisted, “the raid came just in
the nick of time. For how could the Germans
have dreamed that we were leaving
for southern France the next morning?”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the luggage of the Red
Cross girls was actually packed and in spite
of war times the girls had added to the
amount. Moreover, they were due to take
the ten o’clock train next day at the Gare
de Lyons. So because they were weary, a
little sorry at having to leave Paris, and
yet curious of the new adventures ahead,
the four girls retired early.</p>

<p>In one way Paris has conspicuously
changed since the outbreak of the war.<span class="pagenum">[56]</span>
She has become an early-to-bed city and
except on special occasions her cafés are
all closed after dark.</p>

<p>So Dick Thornton, although not leaving
with the girls the next day, found little to
amuse him on the same evening. He had
said good-night soon after dinner and then
gone for a long walk. For in truth he did
not wish to have an intimate farewell talk
with his sister or any one of her friends.</p>

<p>The hazards of war had used Dick pretty
severely. He had not come to Europe to
act as a soldier; nevertheless, in a tragically
short time, before he had even begun to
be fairly useful, he had paid a cruel penalty.
Dick believed that he would never again
be able to use his right arm.</p>

<p>He did not intend, however, to allow this
to make him morose or disagreeable and so
seldom spoke of it. But now and then he
used to desert his four feminine companions
and walking through the semi-darkened
streets of Paris try to work out a
solution for his future.</p>

<p>So by chance it was Dick who gave the
alarm to the household on the night of
Paris’ long-anticipated Zeppelin raid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[57]</span></p>

<p>He had just come home and was standing
idly before the door waiting to awaken
the concierge who presides over the destinies
of all Parisian apartment houses.
A beautiful night, the sky was thickly
studded with stars, although there was no
moon.</p>

<p>Suddenly Dick heard a tremendous explosion.
Naturally his first thought was a
bomb and then he smiled at himself. In
war times every noise suggested a bomb.
This noise may have been nothing but an
unusually loud automobile tire explosion.
However, Dick was not particularly convinced
by his own suggestion. He remained
quiet for another moment with all his
senses acute. The streets in his neighborhood
had been well-nigh deserted at the
moment of the shock. If it were nothing
they would still continue so. A brief
time only was necessary for finding out.
For an instant later windows were thrown
open and every variety of heads thrust
forth with eyes upturned toward the sky.</p>

<p>Then a fire engine rattled by and afar
off a bugle call sounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[58]</span></p>

<p>That moment Dick pounded at the closed
door of their house, but the concierge was
already awake and let him in at once.
Then with a few bounds he cleared the
steps and stood knocking at his sister’s
bedroom door.</p>

<p>“Something startling is happening, I
don’t know exactly what,” he announced
hurriedly. “But you girls had best get on
some clothes and come out. I am going
up on the roof. If it is a Zeppelin raid the
city officials have warned people to go down
to the cellars. I’ll let you know in half a
minute.”</p>

<p>But in half a minute Dick did not
return. There seemed to be no danger for
the present at least, and besides he had a
masculine contempt for the length of time
it takes girls to put on their clothes, even
in times of emergency. Moreover, he kept
staring up at the heavens too entranced by
the spectacle to think of danger.</p>

<p>Five Zeppelins were passing over Paris,
the projectiles which they dropped in
passing leaving long trails of light behind
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[59]</span></p>

<p>Soon after a small voice spoke at Dick’s
elbow: “It’s wonderful, isn’t it? When I
was a little girl I could never have believed
that I should see real fireworks like
these.”</p>

<p>Without glancing around Dick naturally
recognized the voice. It always amused
him to hear Barbara talk of the days when
she was little, as she appeared so far from
anything else even now.</p>

<p>“You had better go downstairs, little
girl, with the other girls;” he commanded.
“Yes, it is a wonderful spectacle, but this
is no place for you.”</p>

<p>Then hearing her laugh lightly, he did
turn around. Assuredly Barbara could
not go down to the other girls, since they
were assembled on the roof with her, and
not only the girls but a third of the people
in the pension. They were all talking at
once in French fashion.</p>

<p>Dick felt rather helpless.</p>

<p>“I thought I told you to go to the
cellar,” he protested. But Barbara paid
not the slightest attention to him and the
other girls were out of hearing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[60]</span></p>

<p>She was clutching his left arm excitedly.</p>

<p>Now they could see the aeroplanes that
had come out for the defense of Paris
circling overhead and firing upon the Zeppelins
and farther off in the distance the
thunder of cannon could be heard.</p>

<p>“Paris is being wonderfully good to us,
isn’t she?” Barbara whispered. “We keep
seeing more and more amazing things.”</p>

<p>Dick scoffed. “I thought you pretended
to be a coward, Barbara, though it
is difficult for me to think of you as one.”</p>

<p>And to this the girl made no answer
except, “I don’t believe any one in Paris
is seriously frightened. A raid is not the
terrible thing everybody feared, at least
not one like this.”</p>

<p>But Dick was not so readily convinced.
There was a chance that these first air
raiders were but scouts of the great army of
German Zeppelins that London and Paris
have both been dreading since the outbreak
of the war.</p>

<p>Moreover, Dick was not alone in this
idea. He could see now that the tops of
all the large houses and hotels in the<span class="pagenum">[61]</span>
neighborhood, as far as one could discern,
were thronged with as curious a crowd as
his own. And from the streets below
chatter and laughter and now and then cries
of terror or admiration floated upward.</p>

<p>Of course, there were many persons in
Paris that night wiser or at least more
prudent than the four American Red Cross
girls, and there were a number of places
where proper precautions were taken.
However, no one thought of going to bed
again.</p>

<p>By and by the three other girls joined
Barbara and Dick. But now there was
nothing more to be seen save the stars in
the sky which were too eternal to be appreciated.
So when the noise of the cannonading
had at last died away, Madame
Raffet, who had charge of the pension,
asked her guests to come down into the
drawing room for coffee.</p>

<p>The girls were cold and dismal now that
the excitement had passed and were glad
enough of the invitation. Dick Thornton,
however, resolutely declined to join them.
He was still not in the mood for cheerful<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>
society, although he did not offer this
excuse. He merely said that he always
had wished to see the dawn steal over
Paris and here was the opportunity of a
lifetime, since the dawn must break now in
a short while.</p>

<p>It may be that Barbara Meade guessed
something of her friend’s humor, for she
went quietly away with the other girls, not
joining her protests with theirs over Dick’s
unusual obstinacy.</p>

<p>An hour and a half passed, perhaps
longer. Dick had found a seat on a stone
ledge between two tall chimney stacks. It
was a long, cold bench and he was growing
rather tired of his bargain. Still, there
was a grayness over things now and daylight
must soon follow. Yet he was sorry
he had not gone downstairs with the others;
it would have been an easy enough business
to have returned to his perch later and
coffee would undoubtedly have been a
boon.</p>

<p>He was kicking his feet rather more like
a disconsolate small boy, who had been
sent upstairs to his room alone for punishment,<span class="pagenum">[63]</span>
than like a romantic youth about to
pay tribute to his Mistress Paris, when
Barbara Meade joined him for the second
time that evening.</p>

<p>However, this time he saw her coming
and her welcome was far more enthusiastic.</p>

<p>The girl had put on her long gray-blue
nursing coat, but wore a ridiculous little
blue silk cap pulled down over her curls.
Moreover, Dick Thornton had to rush forward
to meet her to keep her from tripping,
since she was dragging his neglected overcoat
with her and also trying to carry a
thick mug of coffee.</p>

<p>Dick snatched at the mug none too
politely.</p>

<p>“I say, you are a trump!” he remarked
with such fervor, however, that any girl
would have forgiven him.</p>

<p>Then Barbara sat down beside him on
the stone ledge and after seeing that he had
put on the overcoat, watched him drink
the coffee. She even added two rolls for
his refreshment from the depth of her
pocket.</p>

<p>“I made the coffee for you myself. I<span class="pagenum">[64]</span>
think it rather good of me,” she remarked
placidly. “The other girls are lying down.
But I had a fancy to see the dawn over
Paris myself and I thought if I brought
you a present you would not send me
away.”</p>

<p>Dick smiled, for the dawn had broken
when Barbara came. From their tall
roof they had a marvelous view of the
city and the long line of beautiful bridges
crossing the Seine. And there, not far
away, looking as if she were built half upon
the water and half upon land, the Church
of Notre Dame.</p>

<p>A sudden glory of red and gold bathed
its two perfect towers and the cross above.
Slipping down between the grinning gargoyles
along its sides it dipped into the
river below. In another direction Montmartre
was shimmering like a rainbow,
steeped in the colors and the glories of
romance.</p>

<p>Barbara shivered over the strange beauty
after the excitement of the night before.
And although Dick was there and they
were good friends, she wished that one of
the girls had also been her companion. It<span class="pagenum">[65]</span>
was a time when she would have liked to
put her hand inside a friend’s just for the
sense of warm human companionship.</p>

<p>But Dick was not at the moment looking
or thinking of her. It was hardly to be
wondered at, the girl thought with the old
grace of a smile at herself. There were so
many better things to see. Yet it gave
her the chance for a farewell study of
him. They were to part now in a short
time, for how long neither of them knew.</p>

<p>The next instant Barbara regretted her
decision. For how wretchedly Dick Thornton
was looking! Could any one believe
that only a little over a year had passed
since their first meeting on the March night
when she had arrived so unceremoniously
at his father’s house. Certainly Dick had
been more than kind to her even then.</p>

<p>A moment later when Dick did chance
to glance toward his companion she was
crying hard but silently.</p>

<p>Once or twice before Dick had been surprised
at Barbara Meade’s unexpected
tears, but now he understood them at
once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[66]</span></p>

<p>He offered her the comfort she had
wished a little while before. Gently he
took her hand inside his left one.</p>

<p>“I know you are thinking of me, Barbara,
and this tiresome old arm of mine. It is
tremendously kind of you,” he protested.
“But I want you to promise me not to
worry and to keep Mill from fretting if
you can. I hate you girls to go off to
work again without me, but I’ve made up
my mind to stay around Paris for a few
months. I’m rather glad to have this
chance to explain things to you. Of
course, you know that when that shell
shattered my shoulder it seemed to paralyze
my arm. Well, I have not given up
hope that something may yet be done for
it. So as soon as I can get hold of one
of the big surgeons here in Paris I want
him to have a try at me. They are fairly
busy these days with people who are of
more account, but if I hang around long
enough some one will find time to look
after me. You know I have never told,
nor let Mildred tell mother and father just
how serious things are with me. But if<span class="pagenum">[67]</span>
nothing can be done I’ve made up my
mind to go home and find out what a one-armed
man can do to be useful. He isn’t
much good over here at present. You see,
Barbara, I have not yet forgotten your
New York lectures on the duty and beauty
of usefulness.”</p>

<p>Dick said this in a laughing voice, with
no intention of attempting the heroic, so
Barbara did her best to answer in the same
spirit.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she had never gotten over
her sense of responsibility and might always
continue to feel it.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am sure something <em>can</em> be done,”
she answered, forcing herself to speak
bravely. “But in any case you will come
and say good-by to Mill and the rest of
us before you sail, won’t you?” she concluded.</p>

<p>Dick nodded, but by this time they had
both gotten up and were walking across the
roof top side by side.</p>

<p>“I say, Barbara,” Dick added shyly just
at the moment of parting, “however things
turn out, promise me you won’t take it<span class="pagenum">[68]</span>
too seriously. Somehow I can’t say things
as well as other fellows, but I’m not sorry
I came over, in spite of this plagued arm
of mine. I don’t know why exactly, but
this war business makes a man of one.
Then when one thinks of what other fellows
are having to give up&mdash;oh well, I read
a poem by an Englishman who was killed
the other day. Would you mind my
reciting the last lines to you?”</p>

<p>Then taking the girl’s consent for granted,
Dick went on in a grave young voice that
had much of the beauty which Barbara
remembered in his song the year before.</p>

<p>“His name was Rupert Brooke and he

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="cheaderfont"><em>Other Fields</em></span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">The work which the American girls
were to do for the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Croix de
Rouge</i> (Red Cross) was to be accomplished
under entirely different circumstances.</p>

<p>They traveled southeast nearly an entire
day and toward evening were driven
through a thickly wooded country to the
edge of the Forest of Le Prêtre.</p>

<p>An American field hospital, an exact
duplicate of those used in America, had
recently been presented to the French
Government by three Americans who desired
that their identity be kept a secret.
The hospital was made up of twenty tents;
six of them large enough to take care of
two hundred wounded men. And these
hospital tents could be put up in fifteen
minutes and taken down in six by the
American ambulance volunteers, many of<span class="pagenum">[70]</span>
them students from Columbia, Harvard,
Williams and other American universities.</p>

<p>So it was thought fitting that the four
American Red Cross girls, who had lately
offered their services to France, should
assist in the nursing at these new hospitals.
They had been located in southern
France near the lines and just beyond the
reach of the enemy’s guns.</p>

<p>Therefore it was self-evident that different
living arrangements would have to
be made for the nurses. So Nona, Barbara,
Mildred and even Eugenia were
unfeignedly glad when they learned that
they were to live together in a tiny French
farmhouse within short walking distance
of the field hospital. There they were to
do their own housekeeping, with the assistance
of an old man who would take charge
of the outdoor work.</p>

<p>The farmhouse had been offered for their
use by the French countess who was the
owner of an ancient chateau about a mile
away. Indeed, the farmhouse lay within
the boundaries of her lands.</p>

<p>When the girls first tumbled out of the<span class="pagenum">[71]</span>
carriage they were too tired to be more
than half-way curious over their new abode.
But half an hour later they were investigating
the entire place with delight.</p>

<p>This was because they had already rested
and eaten a supper that would have served
for all the good little princesses in the fairy
stories.</p>

<p>Naturally the girls had expected to find
their little house empty. But no sooner
had they started up the cobblestone path
to the blue front door when an old man
appeared on the threshold, bowing with
the grace of an eighteenth century courtier.
He was only François, the old French peasant
who was to be of what service he could
to them.</p>

<p>There in the clean-scrubbed dining room
stood a round oak table set with odd pieces
of china, white and blue and gold, hundreds
of years old and more valuable than
any but a connoisseur could appreciate.</p>

<p>François himself waited to serve supper.
The Countess, whose servant he had been
for fifty years, had sent over the food&mdash;a
pitcher of new milk, a square of golden<span class="pagenum">[72]</span>
honey, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit fromage</i>, which is a delicious
cream cheese that only the French can
make, and a great bowl of wild strawberries,
which ripen in autumn in southern
France. Besides this there was a big loaf
of snowy bread.</p>

<p>Barbara straightway threw her bonnet
and coat aside. Then as she found the
first place at the table she exclaimed, “So
this is what one has to eat in France in
war times!”</p>

<p>A few moments later Mildred took her
place at what was hereafter to be known as
the head of the table, with Eugenia just
across and Barbara and Nona on either
side. For so almost unconsciously the
little family of four girls arranged themselves.
Although it was not until later
that Mildred Thornton was to prove the
real authority in domestic matters, while
Eugenia continued to regard herself as
intellectual head of the family, with Nona
and Barbara as talented but at times tiresome
children.</p>

<p>However, after thanks and good-byes
were said to old François, the girls started<span class="pagenum">[73]</span>
on their tour of the little house. Evidently
it had belonged to real farmer
people who must have worked some of the
land of the countess. Doubtless the men
had gone to war and the women found
employment elsewhere.</p>

<p>The farmhouse was only one story and
a half high, with the kitchen and dining
room below, but above there were four
small bedrooms with a single window each
and sloping ceilings. But the charming
thing was that the walls were of rough
plaster painted in beautiful colors&mdash;one
rose, one blue, one yellow and the other
lavender.</p>

<p>So the girls chose each the color she most
loved&mdash;Barbara the blue, Nona the pink,
Mildred the lavender, and Eugenia, professing
not to care, the yellow.</p>

<p>It was just about dusk when they
finally came outdoors again for a better
view of the house itself. They had scarcely
done more than glanced at it on entering.</p>

<p>The farmhouse was built of wood which
had once been white but was now a light
gray with the most wonderful turquoise
blue door and shutters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[74]</span></p>

<p>Indeed, the girls were to find out later
that the little place was known in the
neighborhood roundabout as “The House
with the Blue Front Door.”</p>

<p>But though the house was so delightful
that the girls had almost forgotten the
sadness of their errand to the country, the
landscape was far less cheerful.</p>

<p>A row of poplar trees, already half
stripped of their leaves, formed a windbreak
at one side of the house. Growing
close on the farther side were a dozen pine
trees, suggesting gloomy sentinels left to
guard the deserted place.</p>

<p>There were no other houses in sight.</p>

<p>“I wonder where the chateau is?” Barbara
asked a trifle wistfully. “I suppose
if our services are not required at the
hospital at once we might go in the morning
to call on the Countess to thank her for
her kindness.”</p>

<p>Immediately Eugenia frowned upon the
suggestion. She was a little depressed by
the neighborhood, now that evening was
coming on, and she still found it difficult
to agree often with Barbara.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[75]</span></p>

<p>“Of course we shall do no such thing,”
she answered curtly. “Exchanging friendly
visits with new and unknown neighbors
may be a western custom, but so far as I
have been told it is assuredly not the custom
in France. Why, there are no such
exclusive persons in the world as the old
French nobility, of which this countess is
a member. Can’t you just imagine what
she would think of the forwardness of
American girls if we should intrude upon
her in such a fashion?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” Barbara replied in a rather crestfallen
voice as Nona put her arm across her
shoulder. Then they started into the house
together. A little later, however, she
regained a part of her spirit, which Eugenia
and the coming of night had crushed.</p>

<p>“I wonder, Eugenia,” she inquired in the
soft tones in which she was most dangerous,
“how you have learned so much concerning
the customs of the old French nobility.
Was it because you were introduced to
Captain Castaigne the other day? I believe
Lieutenant Hume said that he really
belonged to the aristocracy, but preferred
not to use his title in Republican France.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[76]</span></p>

<p>Eugenia flushed and was about to answer
curtly when Mildred Thornton interposed
good-naturedly:</p>

<p>“For goodness sakes, children, don’t
quarrel on our first evening, or you may
bring us bad luck! Remember, we have
got to prove that girls can live and work
together. But I don’t want to preach.
Let’s go to bed so we can get up early in
the morning and unpack and get used to
things about the house. I have no doubt
some one from the field hospital will come
over to tell us what they wish us to do.
I am afraid I don’t know much about
housekeeping or cooking except for the
sick, but I am certainly going to try and
learn.”</p>

<p>So the girls went in and each one lighted
a candle and retired to her own room.</p>

<p>When she was nearly asleep, however,
Barbara was startled by a head being
thrust inside her door. Then by her
flickering light she discovered Eugenia’s
face looking uncommonly handsome with
two long braids of dark hair framing her
clear-cut features.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[77]</span></p>

<p>“Sorry I was so cross, Barbara,” she
whispered. “You know, child, sometimes
I feel that I must have been born an old
maid.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="cheaderfont"><em>The Chateau</em></span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">Next morning Mildred and Eugenia
went over the field hospital with
a French officer who had been sent
to receive them.</p>

<p>Barbara and Nona, therefore, undertook
the unpacking and arranging of their belongings
and also the task of preparing
lunch, which was to be a light one. Indeed,
all the household arrangements must be of
the simplest, so that the girls might have
their strength and enthusiasm to give to
the work of nursing.</p>

<p>But because they had gotten up soon
after daylight, Nona and Barbara found
that they had two hours of freedom which
might be spent in investigating the neighborhood.
So putting on ordinary clothes
instead of their nursing uniforms, they set
out for a walk.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” Barbara suggested, making<span class="pagenum">[79]</span>
an odd grimace, “that there is no special
harm in our walking through the estate
of the countess and possibly looking at the
chateau if we chance to be in the vicinity.
I don’t believe that we can do much strolling
about here without encroaching on her
place. From what François told us yesterday
she owns most of the countryside.”</p>

<p>Nona laughed. “That is possibly an
exaggeration. Still, I would like to see
the old chateau immensely. In spite of
Eugenia, I agree with you that we may be
permitted to humbly gaze upon it without
attempting to speak to any one. I wonder
in which direction we ought to go to discover
it?”</p>

<p>The girls had gone several yards now and
Barbara stopped and wheeled about.</p>

<p>“There is a pine forest over there to the
left that is so lovely it won’t matter if it
brings us out at the end of nowhere. Only
we ought to drop bits of paper behind us
like Hop o’ My Thumb for fear of getting
lost.”</p>

<p>“I have a fairly good bump of locality,”
the other girl answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[80]</span></p>

<p>Then in spite of the fact that they were
two feminine persons, neither of the girls
spoke again until they had walked at least
a mile. Having come unexpectedly upon
a shining pool of water, it was then impossible
not to utter exclamations of delight.</p>

<p>Nona dropped down on her knees and
stared into the depth of it. “Have you
read ‘Peleas and Melisande,’ Barbara?”
she asked. “It opens in the most exquisite
fashion with Melisande gazing down into
the depth of the pool and crying over something
she has lost. One never knows
exactly what it is, but I always thought the
entire story meant a reaching after the
light. I suppose that is what war is, though
it is a cruel and horrible way of searching
for it.”</p>

<p>Barbara nodded, although she did not
know exactly what her friend was talking
about. There was a poetic streak in Nona
Davis that no other one of the four girls
possessed. During her lonely childhood
she seemed to have read an odd assortment
of books. Of course she had not the real
information that Eugenia had, but what she<span class="pagenum">[81]</span>
knew was more fascinating, at least according
to Barbara Meade’s ideas.</p>

<p>“Well, I hope that war may never cross
the border line into these forests,” Nona
added thoughtfully, “although I can imagine
any one who knew them could play
hide and seek with an enemy for a long
time. There is a little hut over there that
seems deserted; let’s go and see it.”</p>

<p>As Barbara had been standing she of
course had a better view than her companion,
but Nona obediently followed her.</p>

<p>The little hut was empty. It was merely
a tumbledown shack of logs and stones.
However, some one must have inhabited
it at one time or another, because there
were signs of a fire and a few old pots and
pans, weather beaten and rusty, that had
been left about. Moreover, there was a
moth-eaten fur rug that may have formed
a bed.</p>

<p>Yet it was lonely and uncomfortable
looking, so the girls did not care to linger.
Besides, if they were to see the old French
chateau during the morning they must find
a place where it was more likely to be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[82]</span></p>

<p>Discovering a path that appeared to have
been more used than any other, they followed
it. In ten minutes after they came
to the edge of the clearing and there about
a quarter of a mile beyond was the outline
of the chateau.</p>

<p>“I suppose it is intruding to go nearer,”
Barbara said plaintively, “but I can’t get
the least satisfaction from this bird’s-eye
view.”</p>

<p>“No doubt of it,” Nona answered, “yet
I propose that we take the risk. These
are war times and very few servants are
left about any of the old places, so we may
escape without being seen. I feel it is our
duty, as long as Eugenia is not along, to
see all that we can before our work begins.
Then we’ll have no chance.”</p>

<p>The chateau was in a measure a disappointment,
because after all it looked more
like an old-time fortress than a dwelling
house, and besides was dreadfully dilapidated.</p>

<p>“But once one was accustomed to this
idea, it really became more interesting,”
Nona finally argued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[83]</span></p>

<p>A part of the chateau must have been
erected in the fourteenth or fifteenth century
when feudal warfare was still carried
on in France. The stone tower had loopholes
for windows with iron bars across, so
that the approach of an enemy could be
discovered and he might be attacked with
slight danger to the inmates of the castle.
This tower was in a fairly good state of
preservation, but the rest of the house,
where the living apartments were situated,
was almost a ruin. There were signs of
poverty everywhere. The servants’ quarters
were deserted, there were no stables, nothing
to suggest the prosperity that should accompany
so famous a possession as the old
chateau represented.</p>

<p>Indeed, the two American girls were so
engaged in discussing the situation that
they were not aware of anyone approaching.
Unexpectedly they found a woman past
middle age moving slowly toward them.
She was alone save that she was accompanied
by an immense silver-gray dog,
which to Nona’s gratification she held by
a leash. For in spite of her bravery in other<span class="pagenum">[84]</span>
matters, Nona was ridiculously and unreasonably
fearful of dogs.</p>

<p>“Gracious!” Barbara whispered, half
amused and half terror-stricken. “That
must be the mythical countess herself.
Shades of Eugenia, what shall we say or do?”</p>

<p>But the older woman gave them little
opportunity for a decision.</p>

<p>She was small and slender, dressed in
black, with a lace shawl over her head
coming down into a point upon her forehead.
Underneath were masses of carefully
arranged snow-white hair. The Countess’
face was almost as white as her hair; there
was nothing that gave it color save her lips
and a pair of somber dark eyes. Her expression
was sad and aloof.</p>

<p>She must have recognized the two girls
as Americans and known for what purpose
they had just come to the neighborhood.
Nevertheless, she passed by them without
speaking, save for a slight inclination of her
head. In spite of her kindness the evening
before, assuredly she had no desire for
further acquaintance.</p>

<p>When she was out of hearing Barbara<span class="pagenum">[85]</span>
and Nona gazed at each other like two forward
children.</p>

<p>Then Barbara took off the small silk cap
she was so fond of wearing.</p>

<p>“I am taking it off to Eugenia, Nona,”
she explained. “Thank fortune, I did not
intrude my western personality upon the
great lady. I can just imagine how she
would have treated me if I had undertaken
to thank her for her kindness and what she
would have thought about American girls
in general. Eugenia put it mildly. Well,
as a greater person than I am once remarked,
‘it takes all kinds of people to make a world.’
And methinks before this war nursing
experience is over we shall have met a good
many varieties. But let us get back to the
little blue and gray farmhouse as soon as
possible. Goodness knows, I would rather
live in it than in a tumble-down chateau!
Besides, I wish to apologize to Eugenia.”</p>

<p>However, the girls had only started on
their return journey when some one came
hobbling along behind them.</p>

<p>It was François and he carried a basket
on his arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[86]</span></p>

<p>Nona inquired a shorter way home and
the old man explained that as he was on the
way to their house, he would like to be permitted
to accompany them. There was a
road that was only half as long as the route
they had taken.</p>

<p>Naturally the girls were glad enough for
the old man’s escort, especially as he was
full of reminiscences of the neighborhood
which he loved dearly to impart.</p>

<p>In his basket was another offering from
the countess. Old François explained that
if she had passed them without seeming to
notice their presence, it was not that she
intended being unkind. She was lonely
and depressed. All her kinspeople were at
the front as well as her only son, who was
the last to bear the family name. Moreover,
they had been poor before, but now that
all their farm people had gone off to the war
and there was no one left to work in the
fields, where was a single franc to come
from? Besides, were not the Germans so
near the line that if the worst took place
they would overrun the countryside and
destroy the little that was left?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[87]</span></p>

<p>Finally the girls discovered that the old
man and his mistress were actually the only
two persons remaining in the old chateau.
When François was compelled to be away
the countess had only her great dog for
protection.</p>

<p>The picture was a pathetic one and Nona
and Barbara felt less aggrieved by the
older woman’s coldness. One could hardly
wonder that she did not care to meet or
talk to strangers.</p>

<p>“But aren’t you afraid to be here on this
great place alone, François?” Nona asked,
more to persuade the old man to go on
talking than because she was interested in
her question.</p>

<p>The old peasant shook his head enigmatically.
But he was a garrulous old fellow
and immensely pleased with Nona’s ability
to speak French.</p>

<p>“We will be in no danger,” he said,
bobbing his head and then shrugging his
old shoulders until all his bent-over body
seemed to be moving at once, “even if the
barbarians should devastate our land. If
this should happen the American girls<span class="pagenum">[88]</span>
must flee to old François for protection.
They could say what they liked about the
Red Cross insuring them from danger, he
knew a better way.” But what the way
was François would not tell, although both
girls teased and implored him to confide
in them all the way back to the “House
with the Blue Front Door.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="cheaderfont"><em>Nicolete</em></span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">For the following week the four girls
were too busy to think of anything
save their hospital work and their
household responsibilities.</p>

<p>But one afternoon about four o’clock one
of their officer friends suggested that they
pay a visit to the French line of trenches
in their immediate neighborhood. Not
the firing line, but the second line trenches
where the reserve soldiers slept, ate, smoked
their cigarettes and even edited a daily
paper.</p>

<p>For some little time there had been a lull
in the fighting, so there could be little
danger in such a tour of inspection. Yet
if there had been, the Red Cross girls would
have given it scant thought. They were
becoming so accustomed to the conditions
of war that even Barbara Meade confessed
herself a little less of a coward. Indeed,<span class="pagenum">[90]</span>
they were beginning to understand why
many soldiers take their daily existence so
calmly and cheerfully, until actually they
are bored, or homesick, or both, unless
fighting is going on or the prospects of it
near.</p>

<p>Trenches, you probably know, are not
arranged in parallel lines, the one exactly
behind the other like long pieces of ribbon.
They often form a series of intricate underground
passages, some of them crossing
and recrossing each other, so that in one
battle front in France where there were one
hundred and forty miles of trenches there
were only twelve miles directly facing the
enemy.</p>

<p>Naturally the Red Cross girls could only
see a very small section of trench life during
one afternoon’s visit.</p>

<p>“But the briefness of the excursion was
the chief thing to recommend it,” Barbara
Meade insisted afterwards, although interested
at the time.</p>

<p>Following their soldier guide, the girls
walked through a deep, wide tunnel with a
wooden paving at the bottom, such as one
used to see in old-time village streets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[91]</span></p>

<p>Inside the light was dim and gray,
broken by shafts of sunlight filtering down
through flimsy roofs of straw and branches
of trees, placed above the openings to
conceal the French trenches from the
German air scouts.</p>

<p>Eugenia and Nona kept together at first
with Barbara and Mildred close behind
them. Every few feet of the way, however,
one or all four of them would stop for conversation
with the French soldiers.</p>

<p>Among the men there were several who
had made pathetic efforts to turn their
mole-like quarters into semblances of homes.
One young fellow had actually swung a
faded photograph of his mother upon a
wooden peg which he had hammered into
the earth. So “Ma Mère” had become the
mascot of his trench. Because of her
presence, the other soldier declared, not one
German shell had fallen into their ditch.</p>

<p>Moreover, many good Catholics had
iron or wooden crosses suspended above the
small heap of possessions each soldier was
allowed to keep in his trench. These were
his knapsack and rifle, sometimes a few<span class="pagenum">[92]</span>
papers and magazines, perhaps a writing
pad and pencil and a small roll of first-aid
appliances presented by the French Red
Cross Society.</p>

<p>Of necessity a soldier’s existence inside
a trench must be a quiet one. Many of
them are compelled to turn night into day,
so they sleep while the light shines and stay
on guard at night when there is always
greater danger of attack. However, as it
was late afternoon when the Red Cross
girls made their tour of inspection, it was
about the time the soldiers enjoyed their
recreation. Only the sentries appeared to
be doing active duty. Many of the other
men were smoking or joking with one
another, some of them were even drinking
afternoon tea after the fashion they had
acquired from the English Tommies.</p>

<p>As the four American girls, preceded by
their guide, approached, walking along
through the center of the trench as if they
were on a city street, first the soldiers
stared at them with surprise and then with
pleasure. It was an odd sight to see a
petticoat in such a place!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[93]</span></p>

<p>Naturally the soldiers wished to shake
hands with their guests, to ask questions
about their wounded comrades, and in
many cases to tell them how they had conquered
the difficulties in their underground
existence.</p>

<p>Yet how differently the four girls were
affected by the experience! Barbara Meade
felt extraordinarily depressed. Even if
the soldiers did make the best of things, she
could not help thinking that many of them
were just young boys who ought to have
been whistling and working in the sunshine,
or else studying or playing upon college
grounds.</p>

<p>Mildred also found it difficult to behave
as cheerfully as she would have liked.
However, Nona and Eugenia were really
too entertained by what they saw and
heard to reflect upon anything save the
wonder of the scene about them.</p>

<p>The American girls were at present
nursing in that portion of France where
the trench system has been known to the
outside world as “The Labyrinth,” so
intricate and maze-line are its passageways.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[94]</span></p>

<p>But it was almost at the end of their
journey when Barbara Meade made a
discovery that in some odd fashion made a
stronger appeal to her than any of the
wonders they had seen. Their trip had
of course been made through one of the
rear trenches at some distance from the
German line. Now they had come to the
last ditch they were to be allowed to enter.
It was less deep than the others and sloped
gradually to the earth above. Moreover,
the light now shone more distinctly, so that
just at first the girls were a little blinded
after the darkness. It was always perpetual
twilight in the deeper trenches until night
fell.</p>

<p>Barbara stood for a moment with her
eyelids fluttering and a curiously intense
expression on her face. Then she reached
out her hand and touched Mildred Thornton,
who chanced at the instant to be nearest
her.</p>

<p>“I can’t understand,” she whispered.
Then without finishing her sentence she
wrinkled up her small nose in an absurd
fashion, sniffing the heavy underground
air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[95]</span></p>

<p>“I suppose our trip has gone to my
head,” she murmured, “but do you know I
thought I just smelt a delicious odor of
flowers. Do you suppose it is because the
air here is different?”</p>

<p>Eugenia also sniffed. “Flowers!” she
repeated indignantly, overhearing the remark.
“Really, Barbara, I don’t see how
you can manage to be foolish so many
times.” Nevertheless, she slipped her arm
inside the younger girl’s, noticing that she
looked pale and tired.</p>

<p>At this time the officer who had been
acting as their escort moved on ahead with
Nona and Mildred following him.</p>

<p>A second later and Eugenia also stopped,
arching her thin nostrils.</p>

<p>For there standing just in front of Barbara
was an unexpected figure. He was a
boy of about nineteen. But instead of
having the dark hair and eyes of most
young Frenchmen, he was blond, with pale
gold hair, blue eyes and the faintest down
of a future moustache. Moreover, he held a
bunch of old-fashioned flowers in his hand,
which he was thrusting toward the two
strange young women.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[96]</span></p>

<p>“There, I did know what I was talking
about, after all!” Barbara ejaculated
faintly to her companion. However,
Eugenia had a habit of paying no attention
to one when she chanced to be in the
wrong.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she remarked graciously
to the young soldier as she accepted his
flowers, for Eugenia could be gracious when
she chose. “But do tell how you managed
to find a bouquet at such a time and
place?”</p>

<p>She was speaking her best school French,
but in spite of her peculiar accent the
soldier somehow managed to understand.</p>

<p>“Out of my <em>own</em> garden,” he replied,
with a faint lifting of the blond mustache.</p>

<p>The young soldier looked like a grown-up
baby, Barbara thought, with his fair curly
hair, his pink cheeks and his china-blue
eyes.</p>

<p>“You see there are long hours here in
the trenches when we men have so little
to do, one suffers the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grand ennui</i>,” he
explained to Eugenia. “So my friends
and I have made a garden. If you have a<span class="pagenum">[97]</span>
minute more to spare will you come and
see?”</p>

<p>Obediently the two girls followed until
the soldier led them to the opening in the
trench that led up to the outside world.
Already Nona and Mildred and the young
officer had disappeared.</p>

<p>But there like a sunken garden about
four feet below the earth were two beds of
bright old-fashioned flowers and small
stunted evergreens. The gardeners had
left a pathway of earth in the center of the
trench, just as one might in any ordinary
garden.</p>

<p>Barbara rubbed her eyes. She was
pretending to be overcome with surprise,
but in reality felt the tears coming. For
some reason she could not explain it struck
her as terribly pathetic that the soldiers,
hiding in these trenches for such tragic
work, should spend their spare hours making
the dark world beautiful.</p>

<p>Eugenia was bent upon understanding
the situation.</p>

<p>“Did you actually plant seeds here in
such a place and under such conditions<span class="pagenum">[98]</span>
and make them grow?” she demanded.
“Whatever made you think they would
blossom?”</p>

<p>The French soldier smiled. He seemed
rather to enjoy the questioning, since it
showed the proper interest and admiration
for his work.</p>

<p>“I brought back the first plant from our
garden when I had been at home on sick
leave,” he explained proudly. “Then without
thinking or expecting the flower to
live, I thrust my plant into the earth where
there was a little sunlight. Then the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pauvre petite</i> grew and flourished and so I
wrote home for others. Later my comrades
grew interested. They brought water
for my plants and saved their tobacco
ashes to put around them. Then they
too asked that more plants be sent them.
Some we found by the wayside in our
walks through the woods. We have been
lucky because no German shell has dared
destroy our garden.”</p>

<p>The young fellow looked so pleased that
even Eugenia, who was far less sentimental
than Barbara, felt touched. It<span class="pagenum">[99]</span>
might be ridiculous to spend one’s time
tending a garden when there was so much
more important work to be done, but
then the French are an artistic and a
sentimental people. One had read of the
soldiers in the trenches planting gardens in
their spare hours without really believing
it until now.</p>

<p>But Eugenia was impatient to be gone.
The other three girls expected to return
home immediately, but she wished first to
pay a short visit to the field hospital back
of the trenches to inquire about one of her
patients.</p>

<p>However, when once they were safe
upon the face of the earth again, both
girls uttered exclamations of surprise. But
neither of them showed the least desire to
move away. For there just ahead of them
was a stretch of level green country with
about fifty soldiers forming a circle within
it. They were not lounging or talking, but
were alert and interested. They were
watching something or someone who must
be in the center of the circle.</p>

<p>Barbara and Eugenia discovered that<span class="pagenum">[100]</span>
Nona and Mildred had joined the group.
They were equally absorbed. Indeed,
when the two girls joined them, Barbara
had to stand on tiptoe to find out what
was going on. Neither of her friends paid
the slightest attention to her. Indeed, it
was only through the kindness of a soldier
who moved aside to make room for her and
Eugenia that they were able to see what
was taking place.</p>

<p>There in the middle of the green space
was such an entrancing figure that Barbara
fairly gasped with surprise and pleasure.
Eugenia frowned with a mixture of disapproval
and interest.</p>

<p>A girl of about fifteen or sixteen was
dancing for the entertainment of the soldiers.
She was slender, with straight black
hair, loose to her shoulders. On her head
was a scarlet cap and she wore a thin
blouse and a short skirt the color of her
cap. As she whirled about in her dance
now and then she would snatch the cap
from her head. Then the girls could see
that she seemed to bend and sway almost
without effort. Her eyes were large and<span class="pagenum">[101]</span>
dark and her lips a bright red, yet in spite
of the exercise of the dance her cheeks
remained pale.</p>

<p>“She is like a poppy dancing in the wind,
isn’t she, Eugenia?” Barbara whispered
admiringly.</p>

<p>Eugenia looked severe. “I must say I
cannot approve of such an exhibition,” she
commented.</p>

<p>For once Barbara agreed. “I don’t
<em>approve</em> either, but the girl is entrancing.
I wonder who she is and what her name
can be? The soldiers behave as if she had
danced for them before.”</p>

<p>At this moment Barbara heard a voice
at her elbow and turning discovered the
young Frenchman who had presented them
the bunch of flowers.</p>

<p>His pink cheeks were pinker than ever
and his eyes bluer. Once again Barbara
decided that he was a glorified, grown-up
baby. He held a little spray of mignonette
in his hand which he tossed toward the
little dancer.</p>

<p>“She is Nicolete,” he whispered excitedly.
“At least that is what I have chosen<span class="pagenum">[102]</span>
to call her. No one knows who she is or
where she comes from, only that she dances
for us here nearly every afternoon at this
hour.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="cheaderfont"><em>Who Goes There?</em></span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">Eugenia stayed later at the hospital
than she expected. The patient
she had left a few hours before
was not so well and wished her to be with
him. So she sat holding the boy’s hand
and talking to him gently until he had
fallen asleep. It was curious that Eugenia,
who was always so stern with well persons,
was wonderfully sympathetic with her patients.
She was firm, of course, but only
when she felt it necessary for their good.
For Eugenia was not a “butterfly” nurse,
the name that has been applied to the
fashionable society women who have been
caring for the wounded as much for their
own entertainment as the soldiers’ good.</p>

<p>So somehow, in spite of her American
French, the boy she had been tending preferred
her to remain by him rather than his
own countrywoman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[104]</span></p>

<p>She was very tired when she slipped
away. She had come to the field hospital
at eight o’clock in the morning, worked
until four, then spent two hours in the
trenches and afterwards another two hours
at nursing again. For it was after eight
o’clock when she started for home.</p>

<p>Naturally no one appreciated that Eugenia
was returning alone. Of course, in
war times the Red Cross nurses had grown
accustomed to caring for themselves as
well as other persons. Nevertheless, this
evening the circumstances were unusual.
Eugenia was a stranger in a strange land.
She had only recently come to this portion
of France, was unfamiliar with the country,
which was filled with regiments of soldiers.
Moreover, the night was uncomfortably
dark. Had the doctors or attendants at
the field hospital known of her departure,
one of them would have insisted upon
accompanying her.</p>

<p>However, no one is sensible when tired.
So for some reason, although a little nervous
at the prospect ahead of her, Eugenia
got away without being seen. She was<span class="pagenum">[105]</span>
determined to give no trouble. Of course,
if she had been Barbara, or Nona, or Mildred
she would have considered it fool-hardy,
almost wicked, to have attempted
walking a mile in the darkness alone. But
with Eugenia Peabody the case was different.
No one had ever thought of looking
after her in her life, and surely no one would
begin now.</p>

<p>The first part of her trip home was along
a path through the open fields. As Eugenia
hurried on toward their little adopted home
she began wondering if the girls had missed
her at supper time. This was the pleasantest
hour in all their day. Then possibly
because she was weary she decided that
they had probably been glad to be relieved
of her presence. For no one of the American
Red Cross girls really cared much for
her. Of this Eugenia was convinced.
Nona and Mildred both tried to be kind
and Barbara behaved as well as she could,
except on occasions when she felt especially
antagonistic.</p>

<p>Once or twice Eugenia stumbled, not
because there were difficulties in her way<span class="pagenum">[106]</span>
but because she was thinking so deeply.
What could be the trouble with her nature?
As she was in a mood of severe truthfulness
with herself she realized that no one
had ever loved her a great deal in her entire
life.</p>

<p>Left an orphan when she was a few years
old, she could not recall her mother or
father. Of course, her Aunt Rebecca, who
had brought her up, had been reasonably
fond of her. But Eugenia was convinced
that she had never been an attractive child.</p>

<p>Yet why, tonight of all nights, should she
fall to thinking of herself? And why in this
darkness and in a foreign land should she
have such a clear vision of the little girl in
the old New England town?</p>

<p>One thing she recalled most distinctly:
she must have always looked old. Strangers
used to discuss her and people used
always to expect more from her than from
the other children of the same age. Moreover,
she had always been painfully shy
and this shyness had colored her whole life.</p>

<p>As a child she simply had to pretend to
feel superior and to be serious-minded,<span class="pagenum">[107]</span>
because she did not know how to play and
laugh like the others did. Since she had
been grown up, and for the same reason,
she had gone on behaving in the same way.</p>

<p>Often here in Europe with the other Red
Cross girls she had wished to be as gay and
nonsensical as they were. Yet she never
knew how to relax into a frivolous mood.</p>

<p>Once the tears actually started into
Eugenia’s dark eyes. She realized that
now and then she had even been jealous
of her three companions. Nona and Barbara
were so pretty and charming and
Mildred had qualities finer than these two
possessions. Besides, the three girls made
her feel so dreadfully old. This is never
an agreeable sensation after twenty, however
much the teens may aspire to appear
elderly. Then Eugenia managed to smile
at herself, although it was a kind of twisted
smile. It occurred to her to wonder if she
had failed to like Barbara Meade because
it was Barbara who had first suggested
that she must be a great deal older than the
rest of them.</p>

<p>Deliberately Eugenia now began to walk<span class="pagenum">[108]</span>
slowly. She did not wish to arrive at home
in her present mood. Having passed
through the fields, she was now on her way
through the lane that led through an open
woods directly to the “House with the
Blue Front Door.” Dozens of times Eugenia
had made this trip in the daytime,
but a country road has a very different
appearance at night. Moreover, the trees
made the lane seem far darker than the
path through the open fields.</p>

<p>It was stupid not to have brought her
electric flashlight! However, nothing had
so far disturbed Eugenia’s progress. Not
one wayfarer or soldier out upon leave had
she encountered, although the neighborhood
was thickly populated with men and
women living on the outskirts of the entrenchments.</p>

<p>Eugenia hoped that if she should meet
a passerby he might be a soldier. There
were but few of them who would not respect
her uniform. However, she was
beginning to forget her previous nervousness,
for this lane was not a frequently
traveled one. It merely led past their<span class="pagenum">[109]</span>
little house into the heavier woods beyond,
where Barbara and Nona had told of their
discovery of the deserted hut and the pool
of Melisande.</p>

<p>There was no moon and Eugenia was
making little noise. She had a fashion of
being able to get about almost soundlessly,
a characteristic she had cultivated in
the sick room until she could move almost
as quietly as an Indian.</p>

<p>Then suddenly she began to feel more
sensible and cheerful. Home was no longer
far away and even if no one loved her very
devotedly, at least the girls would have
saved supper for her. Food would go a
long way toward dispelling her blues.</p>

<p>Unconsciously Eugenia was moving more
rapidly. She had almost broken into a run
before she became aware of footsteps behind
her. Then, although pausing for
about half a second to find out, she could
not decide whether one or half a dozen
persons were following her.</p>

<p>It was most unreasonable of Eugenia.
She had no cause for thinking that the
presence of other persons traveling the same<span class="pagenum">[110]</span>
lane meant they were in pursuit of her.
But have you ever given way to an attack
of melancholy? Then you know that
invariably it leaves your nerves unstrung
and ready for a collapse.</p>

<p>Certainly Eugenia did not consider herself
beautiful or attractive, yet even in the
midst of her self-depreciation she had not
thought to bewail her own lack of judgment.
Nevertheless, almost at once after hearing
the steps she started to run. This was, of
course, the most ridiculous thing she could
have done. A moment’s thought and she
must have appreciated the fact. These
were war times and the suggestion that one
wished to escape a pursuer was in itself a
sign of guilt.</p>

<p>Immediately Eugenia increased her speed,
at the same instant the persons or things
behind her gave chase. The next moment
a voice rang out. Something it
said in French which held a tone of authority.
However, Eugenia paid it not the
slightest attention. Only a quarter of a
mile beyond lay “The House with the
Blue Front Door,” so her one idea now was
to reach it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[111]</span></p>

<p>“Barbara! Barbara!” Eugenia called
faintly, though just why she should have
endeavored to summon the smallest and
apparently the most timid of the Red Cross
girls, far be it from Eugenia to understand
either then or afterwards. Fright sometimes
makes one do extraordinary things.</p>

<p>But imagine the stately Eugenia running
through the night with her nurse’s coat
forming a kind of sail behind her, her bonnet
in her hand and her heavy hair unbound
and falling down her neck, crying out to
Barbara for protection.</p>

<p>But Barbara herself could not have run
faster, for now Eugenia had real cause for
fear.  A great something was pounding
nearer and nearer her. The sound it made
was scarcely human. Then again a voice
shouted a few words sharply in French.
In her terror Eugenia could not comprehend
their meaning. Nevertheless, she
must have hesitated for an instant, for
immediately after something struck her on
either shoulder. Falling, she was thus
unable to see what had happened, but remained
mute with the horror. The tremendous<span class="pagenum">[112]</span>
thing still hovered over her so
that she dared not speak or move.</p>

<p>Naturally an eternity seemed to have
passed over Eugenia. However, it was only
another moment before a light flashed in her
face.</p>

<p>“Sacre cœur!” she heard a voice exclaim.
“Une femme!”</p>

<p>Then the great creature that had pinned
her down moved away and Eugenia felt a
hand upon her arm.</p>

<p>“I beg a thousand pardons,” a voice said
in English. “You will never be able to
forgive me. But why did you not halt
when I called out to you? I am a French
officer and feared you were a runaway
soldier or a thief. They come now and
then to our camp. But that I should allow
you to be struck down by my dog! Monsieur
le Duc, I am most bitterly ashamed
of you. You at least should have known
better.”</p>

<p>This last remark was addressed to the
dog, in order to gain time and to help
cover the young French officer’s chagrin
and confusion. With his light he had of<span class="pagenum">[113]</span>
course discovered that Eugenia was wearing
a nurse’s uniform, which made his act
the more unpardonable. Nevertheless, as
he apologized he was struggling to help
her to arise.</p>

<p>By this time Eugenia was more or less
herself again and moreover was exceedingly
angry. She was frightened and hurt
by her experience, but more, her dignity
was upset as it had never been before.</p>

<p>Eugenia disdained the French officer’s
assistance. Quickly as possible she got up
on her feet, though still unable to speak
because of a queer contraction in her throat
and odd shaking of her knees. One glance
she deigned to give at the great beast that
had so frightened her. She could only see
the outline of an immense dog, that appeared
as apologetic as the man since his
master’s rebuke. But Eugenia would not
look at the young officer. However, it
would have done little good, for she could
not have seen him with any distinctness
in the darkness.</p>

<p>Yet Eugenia would have been both
amazed and annoyed if she had dreamed of<span class="pagenum">[114]</span>
how clearly the offender could see her. He
had managed to turn his flashlight upon
her in such a way that he had a perfect
vision of her without being seen.</p>

<p>Curiously Eugenia was looking unusually
handsome. Her cheeks were brilliantly
flushed and her dark eyes glowing with a
mixture of emotions. Moreover, she had
beautiful hair when it was unbound, although
few people realized it after she had
twisted it into a tight rope to adorn her
head.</p>

<p>“I presume your mistake was unintentional,”
she remarked in an icy voice, “but
please in future be more careful of the
victims of your mistakes.”</p>

<p>Surely Eugenia had forgotten that she
was speaking to an officer in the French
army, for her tone was that of a severe elder
addressing an erring child. She did not
at present know the officer’s rank, age nor
condition of life. But one is by no means
sure that any possible consideration would
have influenced Eugenia in her present
mood.</p>

<p>“No, I prefer to find my way home<span class="pagenum">[115]</span>
alone,” she continued in answer to her companion’s
humble request to accompany
her.</p>

<p>So Eugenia walked on with her head
very high for the rest of the journey, pretending
not to know that the officer and his
dog were keeping at a respectful distance
in order to afford her a safe escort.</p>

<p>This was scarcely necessary “after the
pot was in the fire,” Eugenia thought,
recalling an old New England expression.
She was no longer frightened now that she
could see the light in their own little French
farmhouse.</p>

<p>Yet to the surprise and consternation of
the three American Red Cross girls, Eugenia
burst into tears the moment Barbara
had opened the blue front door.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="cheaderfont"><em>A Conversation</em></span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">Eugenia sat in an old oak chair in
the farmhouse dining room while
Barbara swept and dusted.</p>

<p>It was the morning after her experience
in the woods and actually she had confessed
to a headache and had decided not to
go to the field hospital for her daily nursing.</p>

<p>At present the four American girls were
on day duty and remained at the hospital
from nine in the morning until four in the
afternoon, their places being taken by other
nurses at that hour. But each girl had one
day of rest and by chance this happened
to be Barbara’s.</p>

<p>Eugenia had been asleep when Nona and
Mildred went away to work and only in
the last half hour had crept downstairs.
All her life every now and then she had
been subject to wretched headaches which
left her speechless and exhausted. But<span class="pagenum">[117]</span>
so far since coming abroad her three girl
companions had not been aware of them.</p>

<p>Now every now and then while Barbara
worked she glanced toward Eugenia. It
was difficult to recognize the severe and
energetic Miss Peabody in this white-faced,
quiet girl. For Eugenia had never since
the beginning of their acquaintance looked
so young. For one thing, she was wearing
a beautiful violet cashmere kimono Mildred
had presented her during their stay in
Paris. She had never worn it until now.
At least the gift had not come directly
from Mildred or Eugenia would never have
accepted it. But Mrs. Thornton had written
from New York asking that Mildred’s
new friends receive some little gifts from
her, and Mildred had chosen four kimonos.
They were too pretty for nursing use, so
the other girls had been enjoying theirs in
the evenings alone at home.</p>

<p>Eugenia had never consented to relax
even to that extent when work was over
and there was no possibility of company.
Now, however, her costume was not of her
own choosing, for after Barbara had taken<span class="pagenum">[118]</span>
a cup of coffee to her room and persuaded
her into drinking it, she had dressed her
in the new kimono without asking permission.
Also she had brushed and plaited
Eugenia’s heavy hair into two long braids.</p>

<p>“Funny for a New England old maid to
be able to look like an Italian Madonna
simply because her hair is down and her
head aches,” Barbara thought to herself
after one of her quick glances at Eugenia.</p>

<p>She made rather a fetching picture herself,
but Barbara was at present entirely
unconscious. Simply because it happened
to be the most useful costume she owned
for the purpose, she was clad in a French
peasant’s smock of dark-blue linen, and
wore a little white cap at a rakish angle
on top of her brown curls. Her hair was
now sufficiently long to twist into a small
knot at the nape of her neck, where delicate
tendrils were apt to creep forth like the
new growth on a vine.</p>

<p>Finally Eugenia, opening her eyes and
catching sight of Barbara, at this moment
on tip toes in her effort to dust the tall
mantel-shelf, said unexpectedly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[119]</span></p>

<p>“You are very pretty, Barbara dear, and
just the kind of a little woman that men are
apt to care for. I wonder if you ever think
of marrying, or do you mean to go on nursing
all your life? Now and then I have
thought that Dick&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But her sentence was interrupted by
Barbara’s dropping the candlestick which
she was dusting and then turning to stare
at her companion.</p>

<p>“Why, Eugenia, I thought you were
asleep,” she began reproachfully. Then
showing the dimple which she so resented,
she added slyly, “But what on earth made
you speak on such a subject? I never
dreamed that you ever had a thought of
such a thing in your life.”</p>

<p>Barbara bit her lips. No wonder Eugenia
considered her a goose, for certainly she
seemed possessed of the fatal gift of saying
the wrong thing.</p>

<p>Eugenia was no longer pale. Indeed, a
wave of hot color had turned her entire
face crimson.</p>

<p>“Am I so unattractive as all that?” she
asked slowly, forgetting her headache for<span class="pagenum">[120]</span>
the instant and feeling a return of the mood
that had troubled her the evening before,
until the excitement of her adventure had
driven it from her mind.</p>

<p>“Do you know, Barbara, I was trying to
decide just last night what was the matter
with me. Now I know you don’t like me,
but I think you are fair. Tell me why you
suppose I have never even thought of love
and marriage and the kind of happiness
other girls expect. I’m not so very old,
after all! But you are right in one idea.
I never, never have dreamed of it for
myself. For one thing, no one has ever
been in love with me even the least little
bit in all my life!”</p>

<p>In spite of the tactlessness of Barbara’s
speech actually Eugenia was speaking without
the least temper, when ordinarily she
was given to showing anger with her companion
under the slightest provocation.</p>

<p>In consequence Barbara felt entirely disgusted
with herself, and what was worse&mdash;ridiculously
tongue-tied.</p>

<p>“Oh, I did not mean anything like that,”
she stammered. “That is&mdash;at least&mdash;why,<span class="pagenum">[121]</span>
of course you are as nice as anyone when
you let yourself be, Eugenia. But you do
seem cold, as if you considered other people
not exactly worth your attention. And&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Not feeling that she was making out a
very good case for herself, Barbara put her
duster down and came and sat on a wooden
stool near the older girl.</p>

<p>“I am an idiot, Eugenia,” she insisted
scornfully. “No wonder Dick Thornton
always declares I have never grown up.
Besides, I don’t believe you have never
had any one in love with you, not even a
young girl-and-boy affair. No girl ever
lives to be as old as you are without&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Again Barbara stopped short, biting her
lips.</p>

<p>But Eugenia only shook her head and
laughed. “I am the exception that proves
the rule. Besides, my dear, you came from
the west and not New England, and you
weren’t, as people have so often said of
me, ‘born an old maid.’ But never mind,
I won’t ask any more embarrassing questions.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[122]</span></p>

<p>Eugenia tried to speak lightly, half
amused and half hurt by the expression of
chagrin on Barbara Meade’s face.</p>

<p>“By the way,” she added, in an effort
to change the subject, “how is Dick
Thornton? I have been meaning to ask
you what you have heard from him.”</p>

<p>This time the younger girl flushed, but
so slightly that Eugenia did not appear
to notice it.</p>

<p>“I have heard nothing at all,” she returned
honestly. “But I don’t suppose
Dick is better, as Mildred and Nona have
both had letters and say there was nothing
important in them.”</p>

<p>Suddenly Barbara took Eugenia’s hand.</p>

<p>“You have more experience than the
rest of us,” she began with unusual humility.
“I wonder if you think Dick has a chance
of ever using his arm again?”</p>

<p>The other girl hesitated. Certainly she
had no right to believe that Barbara felt
more than the natural interest in Dick
that they all had for Mildred’s brother and
their own friend. And, as Barbara had
just suggested, Eugenia was not supposed<span class="pagenum">[123]</span>
even to think on romantic subjects. Nevertheless,
her voice was unusually gentle as
she replied:</p>

<p>“I don’t really know one thing in the
world about it, Barbara, but Dick is young
and has lots of determination and most
certainly I have not given up hope.”</p>

<p>Eugenia had another twinge of pain in
her temples at this second and so closed
her eyes. Although hearing a knock at
their back door, she did not open them
even when Barbara left the room.</p>

<p>A moment later, hearing a strange sound,
she was surprised by a sudden sense of
terror, almost of suffocation. Yet surely
she must be in a kind of nightmare brought
on by her illness, since the sound suggested
the footsteps which had pursued her the
night before and brought on the same
unreasoning fear.</p>

<p>Clutching the sides of her chair, Eugenia
stared ahead of her.</p>

<p>There in the doorway, leading from the
kitchen into the principal room of the farmhouse,
stood an immense dog. It was odd
the manner in which he surveyed Eugenia.<span class="pagenum">[124]</span>
There was suspicion, distrust and withal
an air of apology in his manner.</p>

<p>The dog was a magnificent creature, a
great Dane, silver-gray in color with a
heavy silver collar about its throat, engraved
with what appeared to be a coat of
arms.</p>

<p>Ordinarily Eugenia had a strong affection
for animals, so it was absurd of her to be
so nervous because of her experience the
evening before. Nevertheless, she felt
again that she could neither speak nor
move.</p>

<p>Yet at this moment Barbara danced in,
pushing aside the big dog as fearlessly and
unceremoniously as if he had been a
Persian kitten. She held a number of
letters in her hands and a big bunch of
autumn leaves. Behind her, with the
eternal basket on his arm, hobbled old
François, the French servant from the
home of the owner of their farmhouse.</p>

<p>He looked like a little old brown gnome
with his crooked legs, his stooping shoulders
and brown peaked cap almost the color of
his skin.</p>

<p>“François is better than a fairy godmother&mdash;he<span class="pagenum">[125]</span>
is a fairy godfather!” Barbara
exclaimed delightedly. “He has brought
us letters and good news of all kinds this
morning. You are sure to feel better when
you hear, Eugenia. But how did you
happen to bring Duke over with you,
François? I thought he was supposed to
stay at home and take care of his mistress
when you were compelled to leave her
alone.”</p>

<p>Eugenia listened with only mild attention.
Evidently this dog belonged to the
countess upon whose estate they were
living. He could scarcely be the creature
that had behaved so unceremoniously with
her the night before.</p>

<p>But François’ little black eyes were
twinkling. “Monsieur le Duc is able to
be with me because Madame is <em>not</em> alone
today,” he explained proudly.</p>

<p>Eugenia frowned. “What a pompous,
ridiculous name to bestow upon a dog, no
matter how splendid he happened to be!
But wasn’t there something familiar in his
title? Surely it was the same name that
the young French officer had used to his
dog the night before!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="cheaderfont"><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chateau d’Amélie</i></span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">“My dear Eugenia, you might as
well confess that you are desperately
interested. If you
say anything else we won’t believe you,”
Barbara declared positively.</p>

<p>Three days afterward, between four and
five in the afternoon, the four American
Red Cross girls were leaving the little
French farmhouse together, and evidently
with some definite intention. Nevertheless,
the journey could have nothing to do with
their nursing, since the faces and the
costumes of three of the girls suggested a
gala occasion. Eugenia, however, having
entirely recovered her health and poise,
had returned to her former manner and
character. Yet she too was wearing her
best dress, recently purchased in Paris,
and was looking sternly handsome.</p>

<p>“Then I might as well not answer you at<span class="pagenum">[127]</span>
all, Barbara, since you have made up your
mind already what I should reply,” she
answered curtly. Without intending to be
ungracious she stalked off in front of the
little procession.</p>

<p>The other two girls laughed, but Barbara,
making a little grimace, ran on until she
was able to catch up with Eugenia. She
was beginning to think now and then that
the older girl’s manner was more severe
than her emotions. Now she gave her arm
a little shake.</p>

<p>“Don’t be so superior, Miss Peabody from
Boston! You must make your confession
along with the rest of us. So tell me the
honest truth&mdash;‘hope I may-die-if-I-don’t’
kind&mdash;aren’t you terribly pleased that the
Countess, whose guests we have been for
some time, has condescended to be willing
to meet us and has asked us to have coffee
with her this afternoon at her chateau?”</p>

<p>Still Eugenia demurred. “Oh, I presume
it will be a novel experience. Nevertheless,
I don’t think we show proper pride in
accepting an invitation before the Countess
has called upon us. It isn’t the way we do<span class="pagenum">[128]</span>
such things at home. If it comes to a
question of family, of course I am an
American, but the Peabodys of Boston&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Barbara’s laughter rang out deliciously.
She was in the gayest possible humor and
suggested a little woodland creature in her
brown cloth suit and hat with a single
scarlet wing. What had become of the
serious-minded young American woman
devoting her life to the care of the wounded?</p>

<p>“But it isn’t a question of family,
Eugenia, or how should I dare live and
breathe in the same world with you, any
more than with a French countess?” she
protested. “But please remember that we
have accepted a great deal more from this
same Countess than a simple invitation to
spend an hour with her. We are living in
<em>her</em> house, we have been eating a goodly
portion of her food. Oh, I know this is
because we are in France to nurse the
soldiers she adores! Still, I can’t see that
this cancels our obligations. Besides, she
is a much older woman and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Eugenia put her one disengaged hand up
to her ear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[129]</span></p>

<p>“I surrender, Barbara, in all meekness!
But really, it is not necessary to produce
so many arguments for doing a thing you are
simply crazy to do. You merely wish to
gratify your curiosity. You know, I don’t
believe that we should be engaging in
frivolous pursuits like paying visits upon
strangers, when we are here in Europe for
such serious purposes. Still, I don’t suppose
that an occasional break really interferes
with our work.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” Barbara finished with
emphasis. Then she skipped along beside
her taller companion like a small girl
endeavoring to keep up with a large one.
“Besides, Eugenia, think of how wonderful
the news is! The Germans are actually
retiring of their own accord! There hasn’t
been any fighting in our neighborhood for
over a week now. No wonder the Countess
Amélie feels like having guests at last.
François says that she has not been so
cheerful since the war began. I don’t know
how you feel, Eugenia, but Mildred and
Nona and I think it a wonderful experience
to see the inside of an old French home<span class="pagenum">[130]</span>
which was in existence long before the
French Revolutionary days. It seems that
this Countess has never even gone to Paris,
nor visited anyone except her old family
friends who are also members of the nobility.
She won’t even acknowledge that
France is today a great Republic. She
still tries to live like the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grande dames</i> of
the days before the Revolution.”</p>

<p>Eugenia fairly sniffed. Also she held
her shoulders straighter and her head
higher.</p>

<p>“Then she must be a very absurd old
woman and I am more than ever sure that
I shall not like her. The idea of not realizing
that a republic is the only just form of
government in the world! I wouldn’t
be anything except an American&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Once more Barbara smiled, patting the
older girl’s arm soothingly.</p>

<p>“Of course you wouldn’t, my dear, and
neither would any of the rest of us, except
perhaps Nona. She is really an old-time
aristocrat, although she would rather perish
than think so. But just the same I don’t
see why one should not be interested in<span class="pagenum">[131]</span>
contrasts in this life! What could be
greater than the gulf between this old
French aristocrat and us?”</p>

<p>“What indeed?” answered Eugenia, more
wisely than she then knew.</p>

<p>For at this moment the interest which the
four girls had been feeling in their new
hostess temporarily died away.</p>

<p>According to Nona’s and Barbara’s suggestion,
and in spite of the distance, they
were approaching the chateau through the
woods, which the two girls had visited the
day after their arrival in this portion of
southern France.</p>

<p>November had come, but the autumn
was so far deliciously warm. Difficult it
was to imagine a world at war on this afternoon
and in this particular forest! For,
by some freak of fortune, this woodland had
so far escaped the ravages of the German
shells. Over it and around it they had
ploughed their devastating way. But until
now the birds prepared their winter nests
here undisturbed in the tall trees, and the
pool of Melisande remained unbroken save
by its own ripples.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[132]</span></p>

<p>Again the girls walked more quietly along
the path under the trees than in the open
country. They were thinking perhaps of
different things, while their eyes were
absorbed in the loveliness about them.
For after months of nursing, sometimes
amid horrors and suffering one could not
afterwards discuss, it was healing to both
soul and body to inhale the sweetness of the
earth and air.</p>

<p>Southern France was unlike the land
lying to the north and close to the Belgian
frontier, where the Red Cross girls had for
some months past been nursing the British
soldiers. That was an orchard and a vineyard
country, this a land of forest and of
golden grain fields. Many of the trees
were pine and cedar, yet there were occasional
maples and elms, and here and there
a chestnut.</p>

<p>A small branch of scarlet and yellow
leaves dropped near Eugenia’s feet. It was
a far call to her New England home, yet
somehow the color and the atmosphere of
the woods awakened home memories. Unconsciously
Eugenia stopped and thrust the<span class="pagenum">[133]</span>
bunch of leaves inside her belt. Against
the blue of her costume they shone like
flame, making her eyes and hair show darker
by contrast and bringing a brighter tone
to her clear but pale skin.</p>

<p>Noticing the attractive effect of the
careless decoration, the three other girls
were far too wise to mention the fact to
Eugenia, or assuredly the leaves would again
have been trampled under foot.</p>

<p>However, they had other interests more
engrossing to absorb them.</p>

<p>Barbara and Nona led a short detour for
a sight of the old hut that had interested
them on their previous walk. But Mildred
and Eugenia were both a little scornful of
the story that this was a hermit’s hut,
uninhabited for a number of years. This
afternoon it was so self-evident that some
one was now living in it that Eugenia
hurried the others away. No one could
be seen at the moment, but there was a pile
of fresh ashes in front of the house, a stack
of freshly gathered wood and chips by
the tumbled-down door, and a scarlet cap
caught in the top of a tall bush.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[134]</span></p>

<p>Moreover, because it was growing late
and their invitation was for five o’clock,
Eugenia could not be persuaded to linger
by the tiny lake which Nona had christened
by the poetic title of the “Pool of Melisande.”
The pool one might visit on
another afternoon, but perhaps there might
never come a like opportunity from the
Countess.</p>

<p>Indeed, as the four girls finally approached
the ancient stone house never
would they have confessed to one another
how nervous they were feeling over the
next hour. Nona Davis was perhaps least
self-conscious. Life in the southern part
of the United States among a few conservative
old families is not unlike that of the
almost forgotten nobility of old France.</p>

<p>The path to the Chateau d’Amélie,
whose title came down from the first
countess of the name, was as overgrown
with weeds as any deserted farmhouse.
Yet who would look down at their feet
when trees more than a hundred years old
stood guard along the avenue leading to
the ancient portico? And in crossing a<span class="pagenum">[135]</span>
rickety bridge could one think of the loose
planks, knowing that the muddy water that
flowed under it was once the moat that
surrounded the feudal palace?</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Barbara had to stifle a
laugh when at length François opened the
iron-bound wooden door admitting them
to the chateau. For instead of his peasant’s
blouse and peaked cap, this afternoon
François wore a livery which must have
been handed down to him by a majordomo
at least twice his size. His small, bent-over
form was almost lost in the large trousers,
while the tails of the long coat with its
tarnished gold lace hung down past his
knees.</p>

<p>Moreover, François’ manner was equally
changed. Gone was the friendly light in
his little dark eyes, the protecting, almost
patronizing manner which he had grown
accustomed to using in his devoted service
to the American Red Cross girls. This
old Frenchman had his nation’s gift of
feeling the part he was called upon by fate
to play. Today old François felt himself
a servant of the days of the great Louis<span class="pagenum">[136]</span>
XIV. Apparently he had never seen his
lady’s guests before.</p>

<p>Hobbling along, François conducted the
visitors toward the drawing room through
a cold, gray stone hall. There was no
furniture to be seen except two tall, carved
chairs and an enormous shield, hanging
suspended from the wall.</p>

<p>Inside the drawing room, however, there
was a kind of shabby splendor, very interesting
to the four American girls, no one of
whom had seen anything like it.</p>

<p>On the floor was a great rug of tapestry
showing nymphs and dolphins carrying
wreaths of fruit and flowers woven into the
design. The blue and rose and brown of the
colors had so faded that they were lovelier
than any artist’s palette could have painted
them.</p>

<p>The four girls sat down in chairs covered
with tapestry of the same kind, which they
guessed must be almost priceless in value.
But there were only a few other articles of
furniture in the room&mdash;a beautiful old
cabinet, a mahogany table inlaid with brass,
a Louis XIV sofa, while on the walls were<span class="pagenum">[137]</span>
not more than half a dozen pictures by
French masters. Nevertheless, the room
was complete in beauty and elegance. So
the American girls did not dream that once
it had been crowded with rare treasures,
sold one by one to meet the family necessities.</p>

<p>However, there were only a few minutes
in which the guests could make a study of
their surroundings. Very soon their hostess
entered with old François bowing before
her as if she had been an empress. She was
accompanied by a young man in the uniform
of a French officer.</p>

<p>The Countess Amélie wore a dress of
black silk and on her head a cap of lace with
the Marie Antoinette point in front. Her
hair was exquisitely white and her eyes
dark. In spite of the natural coldness and
hauteur of her expression she was evidently
trying to appear friendly.</p>

<p>Her four guests bowed gravely as she
shook hands with them, welcoming them to
her home. However, it must be confessed
that Eugenia’s bow was even more stiff
than her hostess’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[138]</span></p>

<p>Also Eugenia frowned, while the other
three girls smiled. For the young officer,
whom the Countess Amélie afterwards
introduced as her son, was Captain Henri
Castaigne, whom they had met through
Lieutenant Hume in Paris, and upon whom
they had seen bestowed the Cross of the
Legion of Honor.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="cheaderfont"><em>The Prejudice Deepens</em></span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">“Then you knew we were here?”
Nona questioned half shyly.</p>

<p>Nona and Barbara were seated
on a wide window seat with Captain Castaigne
beside them. A little further on
Eugenia, in a carved, high-back chair, was
watching the group but taking little part in
the conversation. Mildred and the Countess
Amélie were on the opposite side of the
great room, still having their coffee and
chatting amiably, though in not an animated
fashion. For the Countess would
have scorned to speak any language but
her beloved French, and while Mildred’s
French was good it was not very rapid.
Nevertheless, her manners were undeniably
sweet and unaffected and the Countess
plainly approved of her more than any one
of the other girls.</p>

<p>Captain Castaigne smiled at Nona.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[140]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I had my suspicions,” he answered,
with the faintest gleam of amusement
in his dark eyes. “Moreover, I
received a letter from Lieutenant Hume
telling me that four American Red Cross
girls had disappeared from Paris and were
nursing somewhere in southern France.”
The young officer bowed his head with a
pretense of penitence. “Also I must confess
that I have asked a few questions of
old François. You see, I have only recently
been transferred to a regiment near
my own home, else I should have prayed
for the privilege of calling upon you. But
not having seen any one of you until this
afternoon, I could not be sure my surmise
was correct.”</p>

<p>In her throne-like chair Eugenia’s shoulders
assumed a straighter pose, while her
face turned unexpectedly scarlet.</p>

<p>“Are you entirely convinced you have
seen <em>no one</em> of us since our meeting in
Paris?” she inquired so suddenly and in
such a peculiar tone, even for Eugenia, that
Nona and Barbara turned to glance toward
her in surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[141]</span></p>

<p>Not having spoken in the past ten minutes,
her eyes were now fixed upon the
young French officer with an expression
which Barbara Meade at least recognized.
It plainly expressed disapproval.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there was no reason why
Captain Castaigne should instantly become
embarrassed. Up to this time he
had been a delightful host, gracious and
gay. Certainly his manners were not like
those of an American or an Englishman,
but Nona and Barbara instinctively understood
that his fashion of paying pretty
compliments and his somewhat devoted air
as he talked to one, were simply characteristics
of a foreigner.</p>

<p>Now, however, he blushed and stammered
like a school-boy. With Eugenia’s
gaze upon him he crimsoned and cast down
his eyes.</p>

<p>“If I <em>have</em> seen one of you before I am
sure I have not recognized you,” he returned
with unnecessary humility. “I
have been at work with my soldiers most of
the time since receiving my new command.
I only return to the chateau occasionally
to see my mother.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[142]</span></p>

<p>Eugenia’s nostrils arched slightly in a
way she had when angry.</p>

<p>“Do you usually pay these visits in the
daytime or in the evening?” she questioned,
with what seemed to the other two girls
rather too much curiosity. For these were
war times when one was not supposed to
ask questions that were not absolutely
necessary.</p>

<p>Still the young officer showed no resentment.</p>

<p>“I have no regular hour, Mademoiselle.
Whenever I can be spared I desire to be
with my mother. There are only the two
of us and we have been much separated.
First there were the years devoted to my
training as a soldier and since has come the
cruel fortune of war.”</p>

<p>From the opposite side of the room the
Countess Amélie must at this moment
have guessed that her son was speaking of
her. She looked toward him with such a
combination of pride and devotion that it
was almost touching. Her whole face
softened.</p>

<p>But Eugenia did not observe her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[143]</span></p>

<p>“I am not so sure we have not met each
other in this neighborhood quite recently,”
she continued with extraordinary coldness.
Nona and Barbara became more and more
surprised. For although Eugenia was not
cordial with strangers, she was usually
civil. Vainly they were searching their
minds for some remark with which to turn
the current of the conversation when Eugenia
went on:</p>

<p>“I was on my way home to our little
farmhouse the other evening, after nursing
at the field hospital until quite late. I met
some one, an officer, I think. It was then
too dark for me to see his face, but I have
been wondering ever since&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>At this moment Eugenia’s speech was
interrupted, but not by one of her companions.
For the heavy door of the drawing
room was pushed slowly open and a
great dog walked majestically into the
room.</p>

<p>He paused for an instant to gaze at his
mistress. Then receiving her silent permission,
he started a pilgrimage about the
room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[144]</span></p>

<p>Nona shrank behind the smaller Barbara,
for in spite of her usual bravery she
had a nervous fear of dogs. However, this
great Dane was not to be feared by guests
inside his own domain. As he padded
from one visitor to the other it was plain
that he was greeting each one of them in
turn. Mildred came first and was allowed
to lay her hand on his head, then Nona and
Barbara. Afterwards the dog moved toward
Eugenia. Within a few feet of her
he paused, his ears and tail visibly drooping,
and turned imploring eyes upon his
young master.</p>

<p>Whatever the signal that passed between
them, the next moment the splendid creature
sank down at Eugenia’s feet, burying
his head between his forepaws. His whole
attitude indicated a prayer for pardon.</p>

<p>Immediately after Captain Castaigne got
up and walked over toward Eugenia. He
stood silent for half a moment, evidently
hoping that she might relax from her
severity.</p>

<p>Never in his life had he met such an
extraordinary and difficult young woman!<span class="pagenum">[145]</span>
As he had been under the same impression
five minutes after their introduction in
Paris, why should Fate be so unkind as to
cause them to see each other again? And
then to place him in such an awkward position
as he now found himself!</p>

<p>“I owe you ten thousand pardons, Mademoiselle.
Ah, more than that, for I consider
my own act unpardonable!” he exclaimed.
“Until you spoke I had been hoping
that I might be mistaken, and that it
was <em>not</em> you whom I caused to suffer the
other evening.”</p>

<p>The young Frenchman cast his eyes imploringly
toward Eugenia, clasping his
hands together in a dramatic fashion.</p>

<p>If only Eugenia had been able to smile
at this moment, how much simpler the future
would have been! But remember,
Eugenia had a Puritan conscience, and a
Puritan conscience often exacts its pound of
flesh in payment for sins from other people
as well as from itself. Moreover, Eugenia
disliked Captain Castaigne’s manners and
appearance intensely. To her he appeared
theatrical and insincere. A simple, straightforward<span class="pagenum">[146]</span>
American apology she believed
she would have accepted at once. But this
young aristocrat with his too perfect features
and physique must suffer for his offense.
No doubt the other girls would
have forgiven him. He looked like the type
of man most women would deal gently
with, so Eugenia felt it would undoubtedly
be good for him to be snubbed by her.</p>

<p>As she now stared severely at the young
Frenchman in answer to his pleading, she
looked like all the Pilgrim fathers’ portraits
that hang on old New England family
walls melted together into one face. Of
course, he did not understand her in the
least. Lieutenant Hume had explained
that the Miss Peabody he had met in Paris
was an old maid from Boston. But this
conveyed nothing to Captain Castaigne’s
mind. Old maids in France were not in the
least like this young woman and he had a
very vague idea of where Boston was and of
what the city could be like. However, he
did know that he had offended against a
Frenchman’s and an officer’s code of manners
and was therefore willing to make any
possible apology.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[147]</span></p>

<p>“You will understand that not only did
I not know you: I did not realize that you
were a woman or I should never have sent
my dog to interrupt you. Why, why did
you not halt when I called out to you? If
only you had given one little sign, made
the least sound! I thought I should have
fainted when I beheld a figure upon the
ground and in the uniform of a Red Cross
nurse, the uniform I respect most in all the
world.”</p>

<p>There could be no doubt of Captain Castaigne’s
sincerity at this moment. Nona
and Barbara, who were listening with intense
interest to his plea, were deeply
moved by the tribute he thus paid the Red
Cross work. But if Eugenia felt this she
did not reveal it.</p>

<p>“I prefer not to discuss the accident,”
she returned, rising from her chair and preparing
to leave. “Certainly I realize that
you would not have desired to injure me
personally had you known I was a Red
Cross nurse. But I cannot see that you
are justified in sending that great beast of
a dog to attack wayfarers, simply because
you do not chance to know who they are.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[148]</span></p>

<p>Barbara and Nona had also gotten up
intending to withdraw with their friend.
Actually at this moment Barbara had the
temerity to giggle, although no one but Nona
was aware of it. It was so absurd to hear
Eugenia lecturing a French officer with
regard to his duties and privileges. It was
even funnier to see the spirit in which he
accepted his snubbing!</p>

<p>“But, Mademoiselle,” he continued,
shrugging his slender shoulders, decorated
with the gold braid of his rank, “surely you
must appreciate that in these war times we
have many dangerous visitors to our entrenchments.
One cannot permit a wanderer
to remain at large who refuses to give
an account of himself? Besides, my dog
would have injured no one. He had his
orders merely to hold the prisoner until I
could reach him.”</p>

<p>Captain Castaigne laid his boyish hand
on the head of the great dog, who at once
rose up clumsily and stood beside him.
“Some day, Mademoiselle, I shall pray
that my dog and I may do you a service to
atone for our mistake. To many a wounded<span class="pagenum">[149]</span>
soldier Le Duc has brought aid on the
battlefield. In any case the offense was
mine, while his only that of obedience to a
stupid master. Say at least that you forgive
my dog?”</p>

<p>The young officer spoke so winningly
that even Eugenia was compelled to relent
slightly. However, she still retained an
uncomfortable vision of herself, face downward
upon the ground with this young
Captain Castaigne holding the light above
her and gazing down on her prostrate form.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she accepted the large paw
that Duke stretched forth to her. As the
eyes of Eugenia and the dog met, the ghost
of an understanding passed between them.</p>

<p>The next instant, after saying farewell to
their hostess, she departed, the other three
Red Cross girls following her.</p>

<p>“What a very objectionable young woman,”
the Countess Amélie remarked to
her son in French, when speaking of their
guests a short time afterwards. The young
officer did not inquire which one of the four
girls she meant.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="cheaderfont"><em>Not Peace But War</em></span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">Later that same evening the girls
were seated in their living room at
the farmhouse. It was almost bed
time, so heavy curtains had been drawn
across their small windows, shutting out all
possible vision of the outside world.</p>

<p>But wearing their four new kimonos the
girls were grouped in characteristic attitudes
about a small fireplace on the right side of
the room.</p>

<p>Suddenly, after a warm afternoon, a
November rain had fallen, bringing with
it cold and dampness. So, although a fire
in France is regarded as a great luxury, the
American girls felt compelled to have one.
It was not of the generous kind to which
they were accustomed at home, but was
built of carefully hoarded sticks and pine
cones old François had brought them from
time to time as valuable gifts. Therefore,<span class="pagenum">[151]</span>
the girls were huddled closer to the fire and
to one another than under ordinary circumstances.</p>

<p>Just at present, however, there was no
talking going on, which was most unusual,
since Nona and Barbara were especially
addicted to this feminine habit, while
neither Eugenia nor Mildred were extraordinarily
silent. However, at the moment
both Mildred and Nona were writing letters,
while Barbara was reading a queer, old-fashioned
book she had discovered stored
away in the attic of their little farmhouse.
It was, of course, written in French, and she
was supposed to be improving her vocabulary.
But the French was so peculiar that
now and then she was forced to stop to
consult a dictionary.</p>

<p>Eugenia was also reading, although her
literature was of a more serious character.
She was studying a series of reports the Red
Cross societies of Europe had recently
issued. The papers offered important information
and advice to the Red Cross
nurses, and Eugenia was too deeply interested
in her profession to neglect any chance
for improvement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[152]</span></p>

<p>She and Mildred were at a small table by
the fire with the lamp between them, while
Nona and Barbara were mounted upon sofa
cushions, which they had placed on the
bare floor.</p>

<p>By and by Barbara glanced up at the
alarm clock on the mantelpiece. It was
standing side by side with a tall French
clock of silver gilt that must once have been
a bridal offering. However, the French
clock had these long years been silent, while
tonight the plebeian American timepiece
ticked resolutely on.</p>

<p>Seeing the hour, Barbara yawned, closed
her book and then, clasping her hands over
her knees, began rocking slowly back and
forth.</p>

<p>No one at first paid the least attention
to her.</p>

<p>“It is nearly bed time,” she announced
finally, “and I do wish everybody would
stop what they are doing and let us talk for
a while. Somehow tonight I feel as if we
were four girls away at a foreign boarding
school, instead of four young women intent
upon caring for the wounded. How wonderful<span class="pagenum">[153]</span>
if by chance we were nearing the end
of this impossible war!”</p>

<p>After this there was another instant’s
silence, though each girl was keenly aware
of Barbara’s last speech. Nona looked up
toward the little wooden crucifix, belonging
to the owners of the farmhouse, which had
been left in its honored place upon the wall.
Her lips said nothing, but the appeal of her
spirit went deeper than words. Mildred’s
eyes suddenly blurred with tears. She had
been writing to her father, whom she
adored, and all at once the time seemed
endless since their farewell. But Eugenia
merely put down her papers and sat watching
the younger girl on the floor.</p>

<p>Except for the fall of the rain the night
was very still. There was no thunder
and lightning and no wind.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was because of what she had
just been reading, or the discomfort of her
visit earlier in the afternoon, but Eugenia
was feeling curiously unstrung. Somehow
Barbara’s innocent remark disturbed her.</p>

<p>“I don’t think there is any chance of the
war’s being over for many a long day,<span class="pagenum">[154]</span>
Barbara,” she returned curtly. “Just because
we have been having a lull in the
fighting lately you must not feel that work
is over. That is, not unless you want to
go home. I often think that best for all
of you three young girls. If you can feel
like a boarding school miss, Bab, certainly
you are an infant. But it is good of you to
include me among the pupils in view of
what you really think about my age.”</p>

<p>Barbara laughed, although a little surprised
and touched by a portion of the
other girl’s speech. For had not Eugenia
called her Bab and laid her strong, fine hand
on her hair? Barbara rather liked the feeling
of Eugenia’s fingers. They were firm
and yet gentle tonight. Always Barbara
knew that they were singularly handsome
hands, and more than that, they were
hands revealing unusual ability. They
were not small, but slender and long, with
beautiful almond-shaped nails and a curious,
vibrant quality at the finger tips.</p>

<p>Barbara took one of them in her own and
studied it curiously.</p>

<p>“You have wonderful nursing hands,<span class="pagenum">[155]</span>
Eugenia. One feels as if they could take
away pain and almost bring people back to
life. Of course, I know you are right about
the war. It isn’t over just because of the
heavenly quiet we have been having lately
in this neighborhood.  But do let us be
frivolous while we can. Mildred, you have
finished your letter, haven’t you? Nona,
when will you ever be through? To whom
on earth are you writing that you can have
so much to say? Whoever he or she is I
wish could see you. You look like a Fra
Angelico angel in that flowing blue robe
tonight.”</p>

<p>Just long enough to blow a kiss Nona
looked up. “Oh, I am writing to Dick
Thornton,” she explained casually. “I had
a letter from him the other day asking me
to tell him just what we were doing. He
said Mildred would never tell him half
enough.”</p>

<p>A strange little lump mysteriously caught
in Barbara’s throat. Dick had not yet
written her and she had thought they were
as intimate friends as he and Nona. Then
the smile that was characteristic of her<span class="pagenum">[156]</span>
ability to see things truthfully hovered
around her lips. After all, did she really
desire Dick Thornton to behold Nona
tonight? Never had she seen her looking
prettier! She had on a blue crêpe wrapper
the color of the Italian sky, her pale yellow
hair was unbound and hanging in a single
long curl down her back. Moreover, the
fire had flushed her cheeks and made her
dark eyes shine.</p>

<p>Then noticing that Eugenia’s eyes were
studying her gravely, Barbara shook her
head and laughed.</p>

<p>“I have a perfectly delicious piece of
gossip to confide, if you will all listen. If
you don’t I’m going to bed this minute.”</p>

<p>Nona sealed her letter.</p>

<p>“What on earth are you talking about,
Barbara?” she demanded. “How can you
have heard any more gossip than the rest
of us? You can’t have found a lost will or
a lost romance in that old book you dug
out of the attic.”</p>

<p>Having at last gained the desired attention
of her audience, the youngest of the
four Red Cross girls was not disposed to
hurry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[157]</span></p>

<p>“Well, no, not exactly,” she hedged.
“And yet I have been amusing myself
fitting the two stories together. Remember
the young girl we saw dancing for the soldiers
the other afternoon?”</p>

<p>“Goodness, yes,” Eugenia replied. “But
what a surprising person you are, Barbara.
She is about the last person in the world
I would have guessed you had in mind.
What on earth made you think of her
again?”</p>

<p>Holding up three fingers, Barbara counted
them out slowly. “One, two, three things
made me think of her. Now listen to me
attentively, for ‘hereby hangs a tale.’
And perhaps if we exercise enough imagination
we can turn it into the oldest romance
of the Troubadours, those poets of old
Provence whose names stand high in the
records of song and story. Remember the
tale of ‘Aucassin and Nicolete’ is over
seven hundred years old! We may have
to make a few changes to fit it into modern
times.”</p>

<p>Mildred Thornton made no effort to
stifle her yawn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[158]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, goodness gracious, do go on and
get to your story or I shall retire to bed.
At least I remember that the blond young
soldier told you the little dancing girl’s
name was Nicolete. It was odd for you to
come across the poem so unexpectedly tonight.
I read it long ago in my literature
class at school. But where, please, is
‘Aucassin,’ the hero of your tale, and where,
for that matter, is Nicolete? You told me
that she was supposed to disappear after
her dance and no one knew what had become
of her,” Mildred protested.</p>

<p>Barbara turned appealingly to Eugenia.
“Do make Mildred hush and not take the
fine flavor from my romance,” she begged.
“The young soldier may not have known
where the young dancing girl lives, but I
do. Indeed, we all passed her home this
afternoon. Didn’t you see a little scarlet
cap on the bayberry bush outside the old
hut in the woods? Well, Nicolete has been
living there recently, with an old grandmother,
or an old woman of some kind.
She is the adopted daughter of some mysterious
person, I am told. You recall that<span class="pagenum">[159]</span>
Nicolete was a slave girl owned by a viscount?”</p>

<p>Eugenia got up slowly out of her chair.</p>

<p>“I don’t mean to be rude, child, but
really I have to attend to some things before
I go to bed and your story seems rather
far fetched. Tell us who Nicolete’s adoring
lover is and wait until tomorrow for the
rest.”</p>

<p>Barbara shrugged her shoulders petulantly.</p>

<p>“Of all the disagreeable audiences this
is the worst!” she asserted. “I thought
maybe you might be interested in something
except horrors. The story is that this
little gypsy girl is really very much in love
with Captain Castaigne, whom we saw this
afternoon. That is, she may not be exactly
in love with him, but the soldiers think she
is. His mother is terribly angry, because,
of course, they belong to one of the oldest
families in France while she is ‘Poor Little
Miss Nobody of Nowhere.’ Then another
romantic point is that the little blond
soldier who gave us the flowers is enamored
of Nicolete. Monsieur Bebé is what<span class="pagenum">[160]</span>
the other soldiers call him, so I wasn’t so
far wrong in thinking he looked like a
baby.”</p>

<p>Barbara did not observe that Eugenia was
frowning majestically and that Mildred
Thornton looked rather bored.</p>

<p>Nona, however, was smiling good-humoredly.</p>

<p>“Hurry up and finish, Barbara. Is Captain
Castaigne pining away for the fair
Nicolete, refusing to be a knight or to bear
arms for his country? I thought he was
supposed to be an extraordinary young officer,”
Nona questioned.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly Barbara was crestfallen.</p>

<p>“I suppose that is the weakest part of
the story,” she confessed. “I don’t know
whether Captain Castaigne cares for this
particular Nicolete in the least. He does
not care for anything but his beloved country,
I believe. But if you won’t be interested
in my romance, please listen to the
first part of my poem,” Barbara begged,
picking up her discarded book. “There is
a translation here of the first verse:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[161]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquote0">“Who would list in right good verse
</div><div class="indent0">Tale of grief full sad to hear,
</div><div class="indent0">Of two children young and fair,
</div><div class="indent0">Nicolete and Aucassin;
</div><div class="indent0">Of the woes he had to bear
</div><div class="indent0">And the doughty deeds to dare
</div><div class="indent0">For his love with face so clear?
</div><div class="indent0">Sweet the song, the fable rare,
</div><div class="indent0">Courtly and well served the fare;
</div><div class="indent0">No man is so full of care,
</div><div class="indent0">None so wretched, none so bare,
</div><div class="indent0">So o’erdriven by despair
</div><div class="indent0">But the hearing will repair,
</div><div class="indent0">Give him jollity to spare,
</div><div class="indent0">So rich the tale.”
</div></div></div></div>

<p>As she finished the verse Eugenia reached
down and taking hold of Barbara lifted her
to her feet.</p>

<p>“You are perfectly absurd with your
little love tale, dear, and I don’t see the
least point in it. Still, it has been nice and
restful to have had a quiet evening like this.
Perhaps it is better for us to forget the
tragedies about us now and then. Besides,
I expect I need more education in romance.
But go upstairs to bed, all of you at once.
I’ll close up the house for the night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[162]</span></p>

<p>Eugenia shooed the three girls away as if
they had been chickens and she a guardian
hen. But after they left her she did not
start upon her task at once. Instead she
stood with her hands clasped looking down
into the fire.</p>

<p>Outside the rain must have ceased for she
no longer heard the noise of it. Indeed,
the world seemed strangely quiet to ears
accustomed to the cannonading she had
heard so often in the past months.</p>

<p>But she was not thinking of this at the
present moment, but of her visit to the
chateau earlier in the afternoon. The call
had not been an agreeable one, for she had
never felt more ill at ease. However,
Eugenia made up her mind that she would
never accept an invitation there again.
She might then escape meeting either the
Countess or her son. And with this thought
in mind she stopped to put out the last
flickering flames of the fire.</p>

<p>There she remained crouched in the same
position for five minutes, while upstairs in
their bedrooms the other three American
Red Cross girls were almost equally inanimate.<span class="pagenum">[163]</span>
For after the quiet of the night their
ears and hearts were suddenly stunned by a
burst of terrific artillery firing. It was as if
all the heavy guns of all the armies in
Europe were concentrated upon this particular
quarter in France.</p>

<p>By and by Eugenia rose up wearily with
her face whiter and older than it had been
for some time.</p>

<p>“I am afraid the Germans have not
retreated of their own accord,” she said,
unconsciously speaking aloud. “We may
have some hard days ahead of us. But if
they do manage to force the French line of
trenches and reach us, I shall not care so
much if only the other girls can get away.
It will not so much matter with a woman
as old as I am, and I shall be glad to be
useful.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="cheaderfont"><em>Danger</em></span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">All night the bombardment continued.
Now and then the girls slept,
but more often they lay awake,
wondering just where the fighting could be
taking place and if the field hospital could
be in danger.</p>

<p>But at daylight the noise grew less and
three of the girls fell into deeper slumber
than they had known since saying good-night
to one another.</p>

<p>But Eugenia did not wish to sleep again.
Very quietly she got up and went about
their little house hiding away their stores of
provisions. Then she locked up odd windows
and doors that might by chance be
forgotten. Afterwards she investigated her
own bag of nursing supplies and saw that
everything that might be needed for emergency
work was there.</p>

<p>Although it was still between five and<span class="pagenum">[165]</span>
six o’clock, Eugenia next made things ready
for breakfast and then went upstairs and
waked the other girls. Well she knew that
their services would be needed earlier than
usual that morning! The night’s fighting
meant many more wounded, who would be
brought to them for succor as soon as
possible.</p>

<p>Therefore, once they were up and dressed,
the girls naturally wished to be off to their
work at once. Yet against their wills Eugenia
insisted that they eat unusually large
breakfasts. She even packed a basket of
food for them to take to the hospital,
although their noonday meal was always
given them there.</p>

<p>However, nothing was said at breakfast
about her proceedings, but later Barbara
followed Eugenia about their little house,
regarding her suspiciously.</p>

<p>Desultory firing was still going on; occasionally
one could hear the cracking of a
score of rifles or the shriek of a bursting shell.
But this had become a common experience
in the past nine months to the American
Red Cross girls and would hardly explain<span class="pagenum">[166]</span>
Eugenia’s unusually serious view of the
situation.</p>

<p>Finally Barbara managed to corner the
older girl in the kitchen, where she laid her
hand quietly on her arm.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Eugenia, please, have you any
special reason for believing that the fighting
is to be more serious in this neighborhood
than any we have yet seen? Have the
soldiers or officers told you to expect unusual
trouble? Tell me the truth. I would
rather know, and I think I can promise
not to be such a coward as I was when our
war nursing started.”</p>

<p>For a moment Eugenia hesitated. Her
face was serious but not severe this morning
and the two expressions were very
unlike.</p>

<p>“I am going to tell you exactly the
truth, Barbara, when I say that no one has
given me information of any kind. I have
only heard, just as you have, that after
months of fighting in this locality the
Germans evacuated their trenches and
moved back of the line of their own accord.
But the truth is, I have been feeling horribly<span class="pagenum">[167]</span>
uneasy ever since I became aware of
the impression this had made on the French
army near here. I have always feared it
was a piece of clever strategy on the part
of the Germans to gain time and perhaps
to bring up more guns. And all last night,
while the cannonading was going on, after
weeks of comparative quiet, I became more
and more convinced of my idea. Of course,
it may be absurd, but just the same I have
the feeling that we ought to be prepared
for perhaps the most strenuous times of
our lives.”</p>

<p>Suddenly Eugenia placed her hands on
either side Barbara’s cheeks, which had
grown round and rosy as a child’s again,
with the weeks of outdoor life and the
easier work.</p>

<p>“I want you to promise me something,
Barbara; promise for yourself and if you
can to use your influence with the other
girls. If by chance the enemy should conquer
this part of France and our field hospital
be forced to move further back, you
will go back with them. But if anything
should happen to make this impossible, go<span class="pagenum">[168]</span>
to the Countess Amélie and remain with
her. She is a stranger, but she is an older
woman and I’d feel ever so much happier
to have you under her protection.”</p>

<p>Trying her best to show no signs of uneasiness
at Eugenia’s speech, nevertheless
Barbara Meade’s face unconsciously whitened
and her blue eyes grew dark.</p>

<p>“That is a rather impossible promise,”
she returned, smiling, although her voice
was not quite steady. “Of course, I am
not convinced that you are right in your
fears in the first place, but if you should
be, why are you asking me to influence
the other girls to leave this neighborhood?
You have a great deal more influence that
I have. Do you mean that you don’t
intend to go with us?”</p>

<p>At this the older girl walked across the
room and stood for a moment by the one
window which looked out upon the woods.
If she had wished to reply at once it would
have been impossible. For at this instant
a tremendous shell exploded at no great
distance away, shaking the little house and
making a noise that was almost deafening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[169]</span></p>

<p>Yet neither girl mentioned the occurrence
to the other.</p>

<p>When it was over Eugenia turned quietly
around.</p>

<p>“I expect to remain here if I find I can be
more useful. But after all, I may be talking
like a foolish old crow croaking over
misfortunes that never come. Goodness
knows, the French have repelled numbers of
attacks before! Even if the Germans have
reinforcements they will probably drive
them back. I only wanted us to be prepared
to meet the worst. But I’m dreadfully
sorry if I have frightened you unnecessarily,
so perhaps it will be best not to
speak of my foolishness to the other girls.
Now let’s hurry and be off.”</p>

<p>But Barbara would not be hurried,
neither would she be silenced.</p>

<p>She sat down for a moment on the top of
a high wooden stool, her feet swinging in
the air, looking like a little girl of fourteen,
in spite of the fact that she wore her nurse’s
cap and uniform.</p>

<p>“I think you forget that we are Red
Cross nurses,” Barbara argued thoughtfully,<span class="pagenum">[170]</span>
talking not so much to her companion
as to herself. “So even if the Germans
do take the trenches in this vicinity
and occupy the French country, we shall
be perfectly safe. Our Red Cross badges
are our protection.”</p>

<p>The older girl put her arm across the
younger one’s shoulder, not affectionately,
but protectingly.</p>

<p>“More than probably you are right,
Barbara. But somehow I’d feel happier
not to have you girls too near here. Many
of the houses may be burned and the German
soldiers excited by their triumph. It
would be the same in any conquered country,
I have no doubt. I do not mean that
I think the German soldiers more brutal
than other men under like conditions. But
remember, we have been living in an enemy’s
country and nursing their soldiers and
even if ninety-nine of the soldiers were considerate,
one might be rough and unkind.
Of course, I can’t make you promise to do
what I ask against your will, but if the
danger comes will you remember what I
have said and try and be prudent?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[171]</span></p>

<p>And Barbara nodded as she got off her
stool.</p>

<p>“I won’t say anything to the others, but
I am going to put the Red Cross flag on our
little house before we leave,” she answered,
speaking in the most matter-of-fact tone.
“It can’t do any possible harm and I think
might have been a good idea all along to
advertise us to our neighbors. Dear little
‘House with the Blue Front Door,’ I hope
we may not leave you in many months!
Somehow I have grown deeply attached
to you!”</p>

<p>A little while afterwards the four girls
started for the field hospital, which was
situated about a mile on this side of the
last row of the French trenches.</p>

<p>Although they had been up for some
time, it was not more than half-past six
when they set out. The air was still and
heavy with smoke. It would have been
difficult to decide whether the noise of the
distant guns or the ominous lull in the firing
was more trying to the nerves.</p>

<p>But the girls did not discuss the situation
as they walked along. Indeed, they<span class="pagenum">[172]</span>
did not talk at all, but plodded quietly
ahead, intent on the work before them and
saving all their strength until then.</p>

<p>A short distance from the field hospital
they were met by two of the hospital assistants.
One of them joined Eugenia, the
other kept in the group with the other three
girls. They were two American college
boys.</p>

<p>“Things are pretty lively around here,
Miss Peabody. I suppose you have been
hearing the racket all night. The news is
that the Germans have captured thirty
yards of the first line of the French trenches,
but of course we are expecting the Frenchies
to get them back again. Still, it might
have been wiser if you had stayed in your
own place today. Your house is a little
farther back.”</p>

<p>Eugenia smiled in a friendly fashion at
her companion. She was surprisingly popular
with the staff at the field hospital,
although ordinarily having little to say to
them except upon matters concerning her
nursing. But the young fellow who had
walked out to meet them was a Harvard<span class="pagenum">[173]</span>
University boy who had come to France to
assist with the field hospital work. He was
one of fourteen or fifteen young fellows who
were able to take down or set up one of the
new field hospitals, consisting of some
twenty tents, in about half an hour.</p>

<p>Naturally as he and Eugenia hailed from
the Bay State, there was that bond between
them.</p>

<p>“Have they been bringing in many
wounded this morning?” Eugenia asked as
quietly as if she had been discussing an
ordinary topic.</p>

<p>Her companion nodded. “It has been
pretty bad,” he returned, trying to speak
with an affectation of carelessness. The
fact is he had intended studying to be a
surgeon after graduating at college and of
course should not be upset by a few wounded
men. But it wasn’t very jolly to see a lot
of fellows suffering and not to be able to
help them.</p>

<p>“Then I expect we had best hurry,”
Eugenia answered. Afterwards neither of
them spoke again. Yet the young man
looked at Eugenia admiringly. Perhaps
she was not as much of a beauty as two of<span class="pagenum">[174]</span>
the other American Red Cross girls. Nevertheless,
she wasn’t bad looking in her
way, and certainly a man would like to
have her take care of him if he happened to
be bowled over. You could always count
on her being right there when the time
came, and knowing exactly what to do.
One couldn’t help admiring efficiency in
this world wherever one saw it.</p>

<p>Certainly the American boy had been
right in his statement. Conditions at the
field hospital were pretty bad when the
four girls arrived there.</p>

<p>All the beds in the tents were filled with
the wounded. Yet every five or ten minutes
another injured soldier requiring immediate
care would be borne to the hospital
by his companions until long lines of them
were stretched out upon the grass. Moreover,
one knew that there were perhaps
hundreds of others lying hurt in the trenches
to whom no relief could be given until the
fighting ceased.</p>

<p>Now there seemed little prospect that a
lull could come until the night. Then perhaps
the bombarding would not be so continuous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[175]</span></p>

<p>However, the Germans must have previously
located the weak points in the
enemy’s defences since the cannonading
had begun the night before.</p>

<p>Three or four hours passed and no one
appeared to think there could be danger at
the field hospital. Perhaps they were too
busy to think at all. Besides, the firing
seemed to be directed upon the trenches,
so that only an occasional shell, failing to
hit its mark, shrieked over them or burst
at a distance too far away to cause alarm.</p>

<p>But it must have been about noon, though
no one knew the exact hour, when suddenly
news came that the French had been forced
to retreat from the front trenches to the
second line. Then immediately after the
Germans directed a number of their large
guns, not upon the trenches, but upon the
little town of Le Prêtre, which lay behind
the field hospital, the forest and the chateau
of the Countess Amélie.</p>

<p>Nor did the shells and shrapnel continue
to pass over the hospital. Indeed, they
sometimes seemed to be the actual target of
the great guns, though this was of course
not true.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[176]</span></p>

<p>One of the white tents was torn to pieces
and a doctor and two nurses hurt.</p>

<p>Barbara had just come out of this tent
on an errand for the surgeon. After the
explosion she found herself standing but a
few yards from the débris, with Nona Davis
running toward her.</p>

<p>“The field hospital is to be moved, Barbara
dear, and they wish all of us to go
along with them. Eugenia and Mildred
cannot leave, but you and I are to go back
to our little house and pack up the things
we actually must have. Everything and
everybody connected with the hospital
must be on the move in the next half hour.
There is a chance that the French may
retreat beyond the village, so as to force
the enemy out of their trenches into the
open fields. Come, we must run for it.
I don’t see how we shall ever manage to
get to our home and back in such a short
time. But we can help to bring up the
rear.”</p>

<p>Nona slipped her arm through Barbara’s
and the two girls started back for “The
House with the Blue Front Door.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="cheaderfont"><em>The Parting of the Ways</em></span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">The two girls reached the farmhouse
in a shorter time than they had
believed possible and at once rushed
upstairs to their rooms. There they dragged
out their suit-cases, and Mildred’s and
Eugenia’s as well, and began packing them
with the clothes they felt to be absolutely
necessary for their work.</p>

<p>They knew the wounded must first be
removed from the field hospital, with only
the nurse and doctors who would have
charge of them. But there would also be
other motor cars to transport the additional
nurses, physicians and hospital assistants.
Moreover, since all the tents and
the supplies must afterwards be gotten
away this would surely require a fair amount
of time. So in case they were late and
missed the first of the departing cars, they
would certainly be stored away in one of
the later ones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[178]</span></p>

<p>“I do wish we had asked Eugenia and
Mildred to wait until we returned to the
hospital before they leave,” Barbara called
from beneath the bed in Mildred’s room,
where she was dragging out a pair of shoes.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t have made any difference
if we had asked,” Nona answered. “Mildred
is to go in one of the first motor ambulances
with the wounded, as she has
charge of two critically ill soldiers. And
of course Eugenia will do whatever she
thinks wisest. Certainly she won’t wait
for us if she thinks it best to go first.”</p>

<p>“I am not so sure of that,” Barbara
replied, and then there was a silence lasting
for several moments.</p>

<p>Afterwards Barbara and Nona wondered
why they were not more frightened during
this half hour. The fact is that they had
not yet appreciated the seriousness of the
French retreat, nor the great task of moving
the field hospital beyond the present
danger line.</p>

<p>Moreover, they were too busy to think
clearly on any subject, and a time of action
is seldom a time of fear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[179]</span></p>

<p>Except for the two girls moving hastily
about, the little farmhouse was delightfully
quiet and peaceful after the dreadful morning
at the hospital. Once the thought
flashed through Barbara Meade’s mind:
“If only they might stay here in the little
‘House with the Blue Front Door’ and
take their chances with <a id="Ref_179"></a>the enemy!” They
would be under the protection of the Red
Cross. However, as they had received
their orders from an authority higher than
Eugenia’s, like soldiers they must do as they
were commanded, without considering their
personal inclinations.</p>

<p>So Barbara, having finished Mildred’s
packing, took her suit-case downstairs by
the front door. She then went up for Eugenia’s,
which Nona had by this time completed.
It was heavier than the other and
she staggered a little and had to stop to
recover her breath after she had placed it
alongside Mildred’s.</p>

<p>Therefore, she chanced to be standing
just beside the front door when the first
knocking on the outside began. Nona had
drawn a great, old-fashioned bolt across<span class="pagenum">[180]</span>
the door after entering, chiefly with the
idea that they should not be disturbed at
their tasks.</p>

<p>Barbara did not open the door at once.</p>

<p>This knocking was not of an ordinary
kind, such as one would expect from a
visitor. It was very insistent, never stopping
for a second; it was indeed, a kind of
hurried tattoo.</p>

<p>“Who is there?” Barbara demanded.
But before any one else could reply Nona
called from upstairs.</p>

<p>“Please don’t open the door, Barbara,
at least not until we are about to start.
There isn’t an instant to waste in talking
to any one.”</p>

<p>In consequence Barbara turned away, but
immediately after she recognized the voice
of old François.</p>

<p>“Open, open!” he shouted, first in French
and then in English, having acquired a few
words from his four American girl friends.</p>

<p>Then Barbara drew back the latch and
François tumbled in.</p>

<p>The old fellow’s brown face was ashen
and the pupils of his little black eyes were
dilated with fear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[181]</span></p>

<p>He had evidently been running until he
was almost out of breath.</p>

<p>“The French are retreating, all our army
at once: They are tramping, tramping
through the fields and the woods. Madame
the Countess says you are to come to the
chateau immediately. Soon the Germans
will be here and then&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The old French peasant flung out his
withered hands and rolled his eyes upward.
Words failed to express his pent-up emotions.</p>

<p>But Barbara shook her head quietly.</p>

<p>“You are very kind, François. Tell the
Countess Amélie we are most grateful for
her thought of us. But we are going to the
rear with the field hospital staff and in any
case we should be safe as Red Cross nurses.
Go back to her now, for she needs you more
than we do. This must be a terrible experience
for her.”</p>

<p>Old François straightened his crooked
back against the front door, which he had
most carefully closed after entering.</p>

<p>“But you must come and at once, Mademoiselle.
For the Countess is ill, perhaps<span class="pagenum">[182]</span>
dying from the shock of the news we have
just received,” he insisted. “Her son’s,
Captain Henri’s, regiment has been destroyed.
Some of the men have been taken
prisoners, the others killed or wounded.
And we have had no word from our young
captain since the fighting began.”</p>

<p>The old servant’s face worked with emotion
and his eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so sorry,” Barbara murmured
pitifully, and then realizing the inadequacy
of words at such a time, turned to Nona,
who had at this instant come downstairs,
carrying her own and Barbara’s bags.</p>

<p>“What shall we do, Nona?” Barbara
demanded. “We should have started back
to the field hospital before this. And yet
if we go now and leave the Countess ill with
no one to look after her, it seems too cruel!
Suppose I go with François and you return
to the hospital and explain what has delayed
me. Tell Eugenia where I am.
Somehow I feel that perhaps the Countess
Amélie needs my care more than the soldiers
do today. There are so many other nurses
to look after them, while she is old and
alone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[183]</span></p>

<p>Nona’s dark eyes looked troubled, nevertheless
she shook her head.</p>

<p>“I don’t agree with you, Barbara. We
ought to be at our posts. We have promised
our services to the soldiers; besides,
I could not let you go alone to the Countess.
Don’t you know that when the German
soldiers overrun this countryside the chateau
will be one of the first places to be
seized? It is the most important house in
the neighborhood and the German officers
are sure to take up their headquarters
there.” Nona held out her hand to François.</p>

<p>“I too am sorrier than I can say, but we
can’t do what you ask of us,” she declared,
“we must go back to our work. Please
try and make the Countess Amélie understand.
Now good-by, François, and may
we meet again in happier times. You must
move away from the door and let us be off,
for we are dreadfully late already from
talking to you.”</p>

<p>But old François did not stir.</p>

<p>“You have lived in Madame’s house,
you have eaten of her food, and yet when<span class="pagenum">[184]</span>
she may be dying you will not serve her.
Because you wear on your arm the badge of
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Croix de Rouge</i>, does it mean that you
care only for soldiers? Because Madame
is a woman and an old one, you feel no interest
in her! Truly if she dies this war
will have killed her, for one does not die
only from wounds of the flesh.”</p>

<p>Barbara’s blue eyes had slowly filled with
tears during the old peasant’s speech. But
now a resolute line formed about the corners
of her pretty mouth that only showed
there occasionally.</p>

<p>“I am going to the Countess, Nona,”
she remarked quietly. “You must do whatever
your conscience prompts you to do.
Mine tells me that we have accepted a great
deal from the Countess and now she needs
me more than any one else. If the hospital
staff consider me a deserter, I cannot help
it. Besides, I almost promised Eugenia
that I would go to the Countess Amélie
if the Germans conquered this part of the
countryside. It was for another reason
I promised, but tell her, please, and she
will understand. Good-by; I’ll join you<span class="pagenum">[185]</span>
as soon as possible. Don’t worry about
me.”</p>

<p>Barbara stooped and picked up her bag.</p>

<p>“I’ll find my way to the chateau alone.
Fortunately, I know the way,” she added.
“François, you must go with Miss Davis,
so as to carry the other suit-cases. Then
you’ll come back to Madame as quickly as
possible.”</p>

<p>Taking a watch out of her pocket, Nona
now glanced at it.</p>

<p>“I am coming with you, Barbara. Already
we are nearly an hour behind the
time when the field hospital expected to be
on its way. If I return now I shall either
find that everybody and everything has departed,
or else it will merely be an additional
trouble to dispose of me at the last. A
day’s loss of <em>my</em> services cannot make such
a great difference. So we can first find out
how greatly the Countess Amélie needs us,
and then tomorrow, one or both of us must
somehow manage to rejoin the army. The
French retreat may not be so universal as
we fear.”</p>

<p>By this time the blue front door had been<span class="pagenum">[186]</span>
flung open by François, so that outside the
girls could hear the tramping of many feet.
But the feet were moving with a rhythmical
swing that proved the French soldiers were
at least retreating in good order. So far
there had been no rout by the enemy.</p>

<p>Now François was in the greatest hurry of
the three. He had taken Barbara’s bag
out of her hand and now laid hold of Nona’s.
Then he set off, trotting so rapidly down the
path, in spite of his age and crooked legs,
that the two girls could scarcely keep up
with him. Afterwards he led their way
into the woods, skirting along by the edge
of the trees and keeping safely out of
sight of the soldiers, although numbers of
them were marching through the same
woods on the farther side.</p>

<p>It was by this time early in the afternoon,
but the girls found the chateau undisturbed.
Indeed, the autumn sun shone
down upon it with the same tranquillity
as though the world had been at peace
instead of war. Across the neglected lawn
a peacock stalked as majestically and disdainfully
as if the old gardens had been<span class="pagenum">[187]</span>
filled with the belles and beaus in the silks
and satins of a more picturesque age.</p>

<p>However, the two American girls were
living in a too tragically workaday world.
They had no thought and no time for
beauty, since a shorter and more compelling
word urged them on.</p>

<p>The lower part of the old chateau was
deserted, and as neither Nona nor Barbara
knew the way upstairs, François preceded
them. He opened first the door of the
Countess Amélie’s room, but found it
empty. Without hesitating, he then turned
and walked quickly down a narrow corridor
to another room at almost the opposite
end of the house. Knocking at this door
and receiving no answer, he crept in softly,
beckoning to the two girls to follow him.</p>

<p>But this room was so vast that neither
Nona nor Barbara immediately discovered
its occupant. Evidently it was a man’s
room and must have covered the entire
southern end of the chateau. Yet it was
almost bare of furniture of a conventional
kind. On the walls old muskets hung and
bayonets of a bygone generation. The floor<span class="pagenum">[188]</span>
was of stone, uncarpeted, and there were
only two chairs, a tall chest of drawers and a
single iron bed in the apartment. If the
young Captain Castaigne was a dandy, as
Eugenia considered him, certainly there was
nothing about his room to suggest it!</p>

<p>But Barbara was first to reach the bed,
because she first saw that the Countess
Amélie had thrown herself upon it. She
may have fainted earlier in the day and
thus alarmed François, but at present she
showed no signs of serious illness. Her face
was drawn with suffering, nevertheless she
attempted to rise and speak to her guests
as soon as Barbara approached. The
Countess Amélie belonged to the ancient
aristocracy of France whose women went
to the guillotine with smiles upon their
faces. It was a part of their pride of class
not to betray their deeper emotions.</p>

<p>Yet Barbara found the small hand held
out to her extremely cold, and it was with
an effort that the older woman found herself
able to stand.</p>

<p>“I am more than glad you have been
able to reach the chateau, Miss Meade,”<span class="pagenum">[189]</span>
she began. “Doubtless you know as well
as I do that our French army is in retreat
and that the German army may occupy this
neighborhood at any hour. But where are
your other two friends? I promised my
son that in case of danger I would send for
you. He could not contemplate the thought
of your being alone if the barbarians overwhelmed
us.”</p>

<p>The Countess spoke quietly enough, yet
there was bitter antagonism in her voice.
One could hardly expect a French woman to
feel otherwise at an hour like this. Remember
also that this was a portion of
France near the border of Alsace-Lorraine,
which the Germans took as a part of their
booty at the close of the Franco-Prussian
war.</p>

<p>The French people had not recovered
from the bitterness of that defeat when the
great war began.</p>

<p>Barbara was looking somewhat nonplussed
at finding that the Countess was
not in need of her services as a nurse, so she
allowed Nona to join her and make the
first reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[190]</span></p>

<p>“We were under the impression that you
were ill and needed us, or we should not
have come,” Nona answered. “The field
hospital has been moved and we intended
leaving with them, so we should have been
as safe as possible. Our friends, Miss
Thornton and Miss Peabody, have gone on
with the staff. Still, we appreciate your
wishing to protect us,” she ended gently.</p>

<p>In reality, both Nona and Barbara were
deeply chagrined at the position in which
they now found themselves. Yet there was
no doubt that the older woman had meant
to be kind. Besides, nothing could be
gained by making a protest now.</p>

<p>Both girls accompanied the Countess
Amélie out of the room.</p>

<p>“I am alone here, except for François,”
she explained. “If the Germans come this
way, doubtless my chateau will be one of
the first places which they will require for
their own use. Therefore, it is necessary
that we be ready to leave at once. You
need not be frightened; François, will go
with us, and there is a secret passage leading
away from the chateau, through which<span class="pagenum">[191]</span>
we can make our escape without danger.
I am going to ask you to help me pack a
small store of provisions, as I think we will
be happier with work to occupy our hands.”</p>

<p>Not a word of her anguish over her son’s
uncertain fate, nor a protest at being forced
in her old age to turn her back upon the
home of her ancestors! Surely this was
aristocracy of the spirit as well as of class,
Nona and Barbara both thought to themselves,
although neither said a word to the
other upon the subject.</p>

<p>That afternoon, between five and six
o’clock, François brought word that the
German army had captured the last line of
French trenches and would soon overflow
into the countryside.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the Countess Amélie,
Nona, Barbara and François, voluntarily
deserting the chateau, started upon an uncertain
journey to overtake the retreating
French army.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="cheaderfont"><em>The Other Two Girls</em></span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">Just as Nona and Barbara had anticipated,
Mildred Thornton rode away
with her two patients in one of the
first motor ambulances that hurriedly withdrew
from the field hospital to remove the
wounded from the scene of danger. But
by another strange mischance Eugenia was
left behind.</p>

<p>She had, of course, continued to assist
with the hospital work so long as there was
anything for her to do. However, she had
previously insisted that she be allowed to
depart in one of the last of the motor vans.
For the truth is she was unwilling to desert
the neighborhood until Nona and Barbara,
having returned from the farmhouse, were
able to go along with her.</p>

<p>So during the last quarter of an hour,
when only the tents were left to be piled
upon the last trucks, Eugenia, having no
more duties to perform, wandered a short<span class="pagenum">[193]</span>
distance away. She only went about an
eighth of a mile along the path that led in
the direction of the farmhouse and there
sat down under a tree to wait for the other
two girls and to watch for a prearranged
signal.</p>

<p>Until she began to rest Eugenia really
had no idea of how tired she was. She
had been up and at work since five o’clock
that morning under conditions that would
have exhausted the strongest person in the
world.</p>

<p>Now there were deafening noises reverberating
all about her, while over her head
hung a heavy pall of smoke, sometimes
darkening the atmosphere, but now and
then lifting enough to permit a shaft of
light from the November sun to shine
through.</p>

<p>At present the firing suggested that the
fighting was still at some distance away,
nevertheless the girl realized that the battle
must be drawing nearer and nearer, for
already a portion of the retreating French
army had passed within sight of the disbanded
hospital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[194]</span></p>

<p>Eugenia was not conscious of being as
greatly depressed by the French defeat as
the other three American Red Cross girls
had been. Her chief thought was the
appalling increase of the wounded that this
day’s battle must have caused. At this
moment there must be hundreds, perhaps
thousands of boys and men lying wounded
and dying in the fields and trenches with
no one to bring them aid.</p>

<p>“If only one could do <em>more</em> to help!” the
girl murmured, clasping her hands wearily
together in her lap, but at the same time
keeping her eyes fixed upon the path ahead.</p>

<p>“Why in the world don’t those children
come on?” she next asked impatiently.
“Certainly they should not have been
trusted to undertake our packing. I don’t
doubt they are putting our new Paris
clothes into the bags!”</p>

<p>As she made this speech, believing that
she heard some one approaching, Eugenia
half rose. Then the next instant she was up
and standing with her back braced against
the tree, upon which she had been previously
resting. For bounding toward her,<span class="pagenum">[195]</span>
with his tongue hanging out and his head
lolling from side to side, was the dog belonging
to Captain Henri Castaigne.</p>

<p>After her past experience it was impossible
for Eugenia not to feel nervous, for
the silver-gray brute was of enormous size
and strength. Yet when the dog reached
her side, for the second time he crouched
down at Eugenia’s feet. This time, however,
instead of hanging <em>down</em> his head, he
turned his gray-brown eyes upward upon the
girl’s with such a depth of entreaty that,
without knowing why, she was moved.</p>

<p>“It is all right, Duke, I forgive you all
the past, even if I have not forgiven your
master!” she exclaimed, speaking in a
friendly tone, although scorning to use the
dog’s French name. “But do run home
now to your mistress. For this, I trust, is
a final farewell between us, as we shall
probably never meet again.”</p>

<p>Even though she spoke thus lightly,
Eugenia was conscious that there might
be a possible tragedy in the fact that Duke
could not return to his master. Perhaps
Captain Castaigne was even now among
the missing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[196]</span></p>

<p>However, the great Dane gave no sign
of having heard Eugenia’s command, but
instead gave her another look of profound
appeal. When she showed no indication
of having understood his meaning, he got
up and caught her dress firmly between
his teeth. Then not ungently but authoritatively
he began dragging her along with
him.</p>

<p>For the first moment Eugenia was too
surprised to make any special resistance.
The next she called out angrily to the dog
to let go; and then, finding he had no idea
of obeying her, tore her coat from between
his clenched teeth.</p>

<p>Duke’s answer was to gaze at her reproachfully
and then to gather a larger
portion of her clothing in his mouth and
start off faster the second time, with the
girl obliged to follow.</p>

<p>Naturally Eugenia was angry. This
objectionable dog appeared designed by
fate to be a nuisance to her. Yet she was
unable to make up her mind what to do.
She could tear herself away again with
another disastrous result to her clothing;<span class="pagenum">[197]</span>
besides, the dog would doubtless seize hold
on her again. And to struggle with the
enormous creature could only bring misfortune
upon herself, since there was no
doubt of Duke’s determination.</p>

<p>So for twenty yards or more Eugenia
moved along without further protest, then
she concluded to call and summon some one
to her assistance. No one chanced to be in
sight, but there were, of course, several of
the hospital workers not far away, so that
in case Duke turned dangerous a shot
would quickly put an end to him.</p>

<p>With this thought in mind Eugenia again
looked at the dog. He was such a magnificent
creature it would be a tragedy to
kill him. Besides, was she not so sick at
heart at all the unnecessary waste of death
that she would not voluntarily destroy the
tiniest spark of life?</p>

<p>Something of this feeling must have at
this instant communicated itself to Duke’s
intelligence, for suddenly and of his own
accord he released Eugenia’s dress. But
instead of leaving her he walked on a few
steps further, stopped, turned around again<span class="pagenum">[198]</span>
and made a second appeal and then went
slowly on a few feet more.</p>

<p>Afterwards Eugenia decided that she
must have been abnormally dull at this
time. But then her attention had been so
concentrated upon the hope of Barbara’s
and Nona’s immediate return. For it was
not until Duke had made his third demand
that his purpose finally occurred to her.
Of course, he wished her to go with him to
find some lost place or person.</p>

<p>Eugenia never considered the possible
distance that she might be expected to
travel, for all at once she seemed curiously
under the domination of the dog’s desire.
For she straightway put her hand reassuringly
upon Duke’s collar.</p>

<p>“It is all right, old fellow, I understand
at last and will come along with you,” she
said aloud.</p>

<p>Then in a perfectly matter-of-fact fashion
Eugenia moved along by the dog’s side.
Soon after she knew that he was leading her
in the direction of the French trenches
which were directly within the firing line.
However, it did not strike her that she was<span class="pagenum">[199]</span>
facing any greater peril than she and the
field hospital staff had been enduring all
day. For one grows accustomed to war’s
horrors as well as to most other things.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Eugenia flinched many
times as the dog led the way, walking now
and then beside men’s bodies that did not
stir either at their approach or after their
passing. Yet Red Cross nurses must learn
a certain amount of stoicism to be of real
value in their work.</p>

<p>Once or twice Eugenia wondered if she
could possibly manage to finish the task
Duke required of her in time to leave with
the last of the field hospital staff, yet it
was odd how secondary this idea became.</p>

<p>Some other guiding force had taken possession
of her at the time, for the purpose
in hand seemed the one thing supremely
worth while.</p>

<p>Only through one’s imagination can the
picture of a battlefield be really seen, for
even when the eyes behold it, the spirit
must act as its interpreter.</p>

<p>For nearly a year Eugenia had been nursing
the soldiers in this worst of all possible<span class="pagenum">[200]</span>
wars, yet it was not until this afternoon
that she had ever visited a battleground
while the fighting was going on.</p>

<p>But fortunately the field to which Duke
brought her was no longer a center of the
firing. The field lay just behind a trench
which but a few hours before had been a
target for German artillery. However,
the trench had already been captured, so
that many of the soldiers who lay dead upon
the ground had been killed during their
effort to retreat.</p>

<p>Therefore the accident that occurred was
not one which could have been reasonably
expected.</p>

<p>With his great head bowed Duke was
treading slowly, as if he realized the ugliness
of the human tragedy surrounding
them. Neither was Eugenia thinking of
herself; nevertheless, a moment later and
she lay stretched upon the battleground,
as still and unconscious as any of the
recumbent figures by whom she had so
lately passed.</p>

<p>There for hours Duke stood sentinel
beside her, yet not knowing whether he<span class="pagenum">[201]</span>
should go or remain. For while love compelled
him in one direction, his sense of
honor constrained him to stay by the companion
who had fallen by his side.</p>

<p>Did Duke realize his own responsibility
in the catastrophe, that his honor prevailed?</p>

<p>The entire afternoon passed and finally
evening came and yet Eugenia did not stir.
She looked an incongruous figure on the
field of the dead. For although she wore
her nursing cloak it had floated open as she
fell, revealing her woman’s uniform with
the cross of crimson upon her arm.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="cheaderfont"><em>The Discovery</em></span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">But between eight and nine o’clock
on that same evening Eugenia
opened her eyes. She was unable to
think clearly at first and stared in amazement
at the canopy of blue sky above her
head. What had become of the familiar
ceiling of her room at the farmhouse?</p>

<p>But then her head was aching dully so
that it made her more uncomfortable to
try to think at all. She did not even wish
to call for the other girls, because Barbara
would probably come to her in a little while.
She remembered that Barbara had been
especially kind when she had just such
another absurd headache a short time
before.</p>

<p>Closing her eyes again, Eugenia rested.
But something warm and soft seemed to
be moving about near her face, breathing
over her in a curious, enveloping fashion<span class="pagenum">[203]</span>
impossible from a human being. It was
like a damp cloud.</p>

<p>Putting out her hand, Eugenia touched
Duke’s moist nose, and then almost instantly
returned to a knowledge of the
situation.</p>

<p>She recalled in detail the events of the
past afternoon, but could find no explanation
for her own presence here upon the
ground among the wounded. For she was
not suffering sufficient pain to suggest that
she had been shot by a stray rifle ball from
the enemy’s lines. Moreover, Eugenia
found that she could move both her arms
and legs without difficulty. They were
stiff, but that may have been due either to
fatigue or to her position upon the earth.
However, the ache in her head continued
so that Eugenia put up her fingers to her
temple. There was a curious something
clotted on her hair at the left side, which
she at once knew to be blood.</p>

<p>Then she understood what had happened.
A piece of shell from an exploding bomb
must have struck and stunned her into
unconsciousness. However, it must have<span class="pagenum">[204]</span>
come from such a distance that it had
spent its force, for she was not seriously
injured. Already the slight scalp wound
had closed and was no longer bleeding.</p>

<p>Eugenia rose up slowly to a sitting position,
realizing fully the gravity of her situation.
Yet she would not allow herself to
reflect upon its horrors. She must decide
what she should best do. Would it be
wiser to stay where she was for the rest of
the night or try to seek assistance? Yet
what had taken place in the countryside
during the afternoon while she lay in a
stupor? Were the French or the Germans
in possession of the neighborhood?</p>

<p>However, Eugenia was not to be allowed
to reach her decision alone. For no sooner
had she gotten up than Duke once more
began pulling at her dress, very softly at
first, as one who has respect for an invalid,
but no less insistently.</p>

<p>A dog’s devotion and a dog’s persistence
are two qualities worthy of human admiration
and wonder.</p>

<p>At this moment Eugenia felt both. She
laid her hand quietly and affectionately on
Duke’s head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[205]</span></p>

<p>“I can’t go with you again. I am too
used up, Duke, to help you find your
friend. You would simply have another
victim on your hands. But you need stay
with <em>me</em> no longer. I shall wait here for
you until daylight.”</p>

<p>But though Eugenia waved her hand in
token of dismissal and farewell, the dog
did not leave her, although he seemed to
appreciate the fact that she was unable to
accompany him. For he gave up his hold
on her and merely sat down reflectively
by her side, as if he too were trying to decide
what course it was wise to pursue.</p>

<p>It was plain that Duke was wretchedly
unhappy. If he could not show his grief
in a human fashion, he had his own especial
methods. When Eugenia put her arm
about his body she could feel the anguished
beating of his heart.</p>

<p>“I wonder who it can be, Duke, that
you wish to find so ardently?” the girl
questioned. “Surely some one whom you
love very deeply! I am sorry to be so
useless and it is dreadful to think of your
friend’s long waiting for your return, so<span class="pagenum">[206]</span>
you must go, Duke, even if I cannot go
with you. Then if you are no longer
needed, come back to me.”</p>

<p>Eugenia made this long speech aloud in a
pleading tone, nevertheless she again discovered
that it was easier to say what this
great dog should do than to force him to
obey one’s will.</p>

<p>Yet while Eugenia was reflecting upon
this fact she had her moment of inspiration.
She knew that in many parts of the army
dogs had been trained for searching out
the wounded. Only a short time before
in the papers distributed by the French
Red Cross Society she had read that these
dogs were sent forth with long ropes tied
about their necks, so that when possible the
wounded were thus dragged to places of
aid.</p>

<p>Eugenia had no rope, but one often
wonders why women are accused of being
without inventive talents. So far it is
true that only a few of their inventions
have been of world value; to find them
one must seek among the homes. This
American girl at once slipped off her long<span class="pagenum">[207]</span>
cloth nursing coat. It was of strong, well-woven
material, yet she managed within a
few moments to tear it into strips and then
to knot the strips firmly together.</p>

<p>Then she tied the long cord about Duke’s
neck. One could not tell whether the dog
would understand his mission, or whether
the rope would be of service when Duke
reached his goal. Yet in every uncertainty
in life one must simply attempt the thing
that seems most intelligent. And Eugenia
felt convinced that Duke would bring his
friend back to her. Then she could decide
on what should be done next.</p>

<p>Duke did seem to understand, for as soon
as Eugenia had finished her task and commanded
him to be gone, he trotted obediently
off until his great shadow was lost
in the distance.</p>

<p>Then the girl lay down again. She had
natural self-control and her nursing had
taught her even more. She must sleep if
possible and in any case not let herself
dwell on her own presence here within the
field of the dead.</p>

<p>When Eugenia closed her eyes the moon<span class="pagenum">[208]</span>
had not risen and the night was fairly dark.
Half an hour later, when she reopened
them, a full moon had flooded the field
with light. She could see Duke approaching
at some yards away. He was moving
slowly and it was difficult at first to find
out the reason. Eugenia rose quickly to
her feet. Yes, it was evident now: he <em>was</em>
drawing someone along behind him.</p>

<p>The girl walked forward to meet the dog
and his burden. Then, although she had
been growing daily more accustomed to
war and its inevitable sorrows, she stopped
and drew in her breath sharply. The next
instant Eugenia had forgotten everything
but that she was a Red Cross nurse whose
purpose was to do whatever she could to
relieve suffering.</p>

<p>The figure that the dog dragged along on
the ground had the face turned downward.
But when she lifted the body up Eugenia
was not surprised to recognize in the white,
still features, the face of young Captain
Henri Castaigne. All along she had thought
it probable that Duke could feel no such
intense devotion for any one save his master.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[209]</span></p>

<p>After the dog’s return the young officer
had somehow managed to tie the long strip
of cloth about his own body. He must
have realized that he would lose consciousness
on his journey to find succor, for he
had been cruelly wounded in both legs.</p>

<p>Never before had Eugenia felt more painfully
helpless. There were so many things
which should be done for the young soldier
at once and she was so unable to do any
one of them.</p>

<p>Of course, she knelt and felt the action
of his pulse and heart, finding neither so
feeble as she had feared. Then Eugenia,
who was given to definite actions, made
another decision.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to be of service
to Captain Castaigne here in an open field
with no water near, so far as she knew.
She had a little in the canteen in her pocket,
but this would only be enough for him to
drink and would certainly be insufficient
for the cleansing of his wounds. Besides,
even with the use of the small flashlight
every Red Cross nurse carries, she was
unable to discover whether the rifle balls<span class="pagenum">[210]</span>
were still imbedded in her patient’s flesh.
Certainly he must be carried to some place
where he could receive proper attention,
but in the meantime Eugenia thanked
Providence that she had with her her bag of
first aid appliances. It had been strapped
about her waist while she sat under the tree
earlier in the day, waiting to start out with
the field hospital staff. Until now she had
no thought or use for it.</p>

<p>Eugenia used the necessary antiseptics
and then bound the wounds as carefully as
possible. But she made no effort to bring
her patient back to consciousness. For the
purpose she had in mind it would be best
that he feel and know as little as possible.</p>

<p>Once her task accomplished Eugenia
again wound her improvised rope about
Captain Castaigne’s waist. Again she signaled
Duke to start upon a journey, but
this time she formed a member of the little
party.</p>

<p>Her idea was to get the wounded officer
back in the neighborhood of the field hospital,
and then if she could find no aid there,
somehow to reach their own farmhouse.<span class="pagenum">[211]</span>
From there word could be sent to the
chateau.</p>

<p>But the trip was a terrible one and took
longer hours than one could have imagined.
Now and then Eugenia would try to assist
by supporting the young officer’s body
with her own strength. But as she could
not lift him entirely this only seemed to
make the task more difficult for the devoted
Duke. Often they were obliged to stop
and then Eugenia would kneel down beside
the body to find out if the young man
was still alive.</p>

<p>It was about dawn when they arrived
at last in the neighborhood of the former
French field hospital, where the four American
girls had been nursing. But Eugenia
found few traces of the hospital left. Everywhere
in the vicinity the ground had been
trampled under foot. The white tents had
been folded, and like the proverbial Arabian
tents, had silently stolen away. Neither
was there a single human being about.</p>

<p>However, Eugenia had anticipated this.
But she had also steadfastly hoped that
here upon more familiar ground she might
make some useful discovery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[212]</span></p>

<p>Ordering Duke to remain quiet beside
his burden, Eugenia started upon a pilgrimage.
She must find something to make
the trip to the farmhouse more endurable,
more possible for the young French soldier.
Yet she could not make up her mind to
desert him in order to seek for help.</p>

<p>At first, the girl could, of course, find
nothing. But by wandering around on the
outskirts of the grounds, where the deserted
hospital had formerly stood, Eugenia
finally came across an old wheelbarrow.
It had been used for bringing vegetables to
the hospital staff, and being of no value
had been left behind.</p>

<p>Scarcely an ideal motor ambulance for a
wounded officer. Nevertheless Eugenia
seized upon the wheelbarrow with almost as
much enthusiasm as if it had been. For at
least it had wheels and she would be able
to push it.</p>

<p>Naturally this was a hard task, but one
should not think upon the difficulty when
a task is to be accomplished.</p>

<p>The blue front door of the little farmhouse
was standing open when Eugenia<span class="pagenum">[213]</span>
reached home. Half lifting and half dragging
her patient, she finally succeeded in
placing him upon a small couch in their
living room.</p>

<p>Then, being the methodical person she
was, Eugenia went directly to the kitchen,
made herself a cup of coffee and drank it.
For her strength had almost given out and
she knew not what work might lie ahead of
her.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="cheaderfont"><em>Recognition</em></span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">However, it was nearly noon before
Eugenia made the discovery
that the entire French army in
the vicinity had retreated, leaving all the
country nearby in the hands of the Germans.
Only then did she appreciate the
difficulty of concealing a young French
officer in her home, who would doubtless be
taken prisoner if his presence and his identity
were discovered.</p>

<p>Her information came about in this
fashion. For two hours Eugenia worked
with her patient, washing his wounds and
even managing to extract a bullet which
had lodged near the surface. Also she
bathed his face and poured brandy between
his haggard lips until he opened his eyes,
only to close them again in utter exhaustion.
Finally, when she could do nothing
more, Eugenia walked to her front door to<span class="pagenum">[215]</span>
get some fresh air. She meant in a few
moments to go to the Chateau d’Amélie
and send old François to the nearest village
for a doctor. So far it simply had not
occurred to her that François and his mistress
might have deserted the chateau for
the same reason that had compelled the
removal of the field hospital.</p>

<p>Outside, like a tired sentinel, Eugenia
found Duke asleep in the front yard. Then
while hesitating to wake him, even to keep
guard over his master, she became vaguely
conscious that soldiers were marching past.
The next instant she realized that their
uniforms were German and not French and
that they wore the eagle triumphant on
their shining helmets.</p>

<p>They were passing close to the little
“House with the Blue Front Door,” so
that Eugenia wondered why no one stopped
to investigate it. Then she remembered
that Barbara had hung the Red Cross
emblem outside and that the soldiers were
treating it with extraordinary respect.</p>

<p>Would they continue to do this after discovering
that the only person beside herself<span class="pagenum">[216]</span>
under the protection of the Red Cross flag
was an enemy’s officer?</p>

<p>Eugenia was convinced otherwise. Captain
Castaigne would be promptly taken
prisoner so soon as she told of his whereabouts
and sent to a hospital within the
German lines. And to be moved at the
present time would probably mean the
young officer’s death.</p>

<p>Calling Duke inside, Eugenia closed and
bolted the blue front door. Then she considered
whether she could manage to keep
the young Frenchman concealed and yet
take the proper care of him. It would be
impossible to expect the assistance of a
physician, for the nearest village would
assuredly be occupied by the Germans and
to demand a doctor must mean the betrayal
of her patient.</p>

<p>It was possible, however, that she could
hide Captain Castaigne away for a time at
least, while she remained unmolested in the
little farmhouse, with Duke as her protector.
She would explain to the German
officer in command just what had taken
place that caused her to be left behind by<span class="pagenum">[217]</span>
the hospital staff. Then there would be
little reason for interfering with her, unless
the farmhouse should be required for the
shelter of the soldiers. But as it was small
and somewhat out of the way she hoped it
might be ignored.</p>

<p>The chiefly important thing was to wait
quietly until the next morning and then
find out Captain Castaigne’s condition.
Eugenia meant to make as brave a fight for
his life as possible. If he recovered there
would be time enough to determine whether
he should surrender or make an effort to
escape and rejoin his command. Fortunately
there were both provisions and
medical supplies stored in the farmhouse.
Judge Thornton had sent fresh orders of
both from Paris quite recently.</p>

<p>So for the rest of the afternoon and evening
Eugenia sat by her patient while Duke
crouched on the floor near them both. No
one disturbed them; the little house might
have been in the center of a vast desert for
any human interest it created. The day
before Eugenia had closed its outside windows
and doors, and since had opened only
the one window necessary for light and air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[218]</span></p>

<p>For the greater part of the night Captain
Castaigne was delirious from a high fever.
Eugenia knew that it would be almost impossible
for him to escape blood poison,
after the dirt had been ground into his
wounds from the long dragging of his body
on the earth.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, now and then the young
officer slept the sleep of utter exhaustion,
with Duke and Eugenia both slumbering
beside him whenever this opportunity came.</p>

<p>Eugenia did not question the reason for
her care. She had not liked the young
Frenchman at their first meeting in Paris.
Certainly their second accidental meeting
in the woods had not increased her liking.
Moreover, she had been entirely out of
sympathy with him, with his mother and
with their French ideas and environment
on the afternoon of her one call.</p>

<p>Yet none of these things counted in the
least with Eugenia. Captain Castaigne
was a French soldier, one of the men whom
she had come to Europe to nurse in case he
needed her care. Therefore he should
have the best it was in her power to offer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[219]</span></p>

<p>Once, while in the act of giving him medicine
to relieve his fever, the young man
murmured his mother’s name and for the
instant Eugenia was moved to sympathy.
All the rest of the time her feeling was
entirely impersonal. Captain Castaigne
was merely a patient who must if possible
be kept alive and later restored to health.
If she had any feeling in the matter Eugenia
was sorry that she had ever made the young
man’s acquaintance before this night.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, at about six o’clock the
following morning, after an entire hour of
refreshing sleep, Eugenia opened her eyes
to find her patient gazing steadfastly at
her. For the time being his delirium had
passed and she realized that he recognized
her and longed to ask questions but was
still too weak and ill to speak.</p>

<p>A half an hour afterwards, after a few
sips of clam bouillon which chanced to be
among the household stores, Captain Castaigne
said a few words.</p>

<p>“<em>What does this mean?</em>” he asked in
painstaking English, appreciating even in
his present condition that Miss Peabody<span class="pagenum">[220]</span>
preferred the conversation to take place
in her native tongue.</p>

<p>Eugenia thought quickly. The young
officer could not entirely grasp the situation
even if she were able to tell him the
entire story. Moreover, at present the
story was too long and too exciting for him
to hear. Also, he might feel burdened by
his obligation to her and unwilling for her
to make the sacrifices necessary for his
safety if he learned the truth now.</p>

<p>So she gazed back at him with the quiet
serenity that made her so valuable a nurse.</p>

<p>“You understand you have been hurt?
Well, I have been appointed to take charge
of you. You are to see no one else for a
time, not even your mother. Try to sleep
now, for you must be as quiet as possible.”</p>

<p>When Captain Castaigne immediately
closed his eyes, Eugenia choked back a sigh
of relief. Evidently so far he had paid no
attention to his strange surroundings. It
was her presence alone that had surprised
him, and he would probably be unable to
make further inquiries for some time to
come. Possibly he would not even recognize<span class="pagenum">[221]</span>
her again. For Eugenia understood
the nature of the disease with which she
was to do battle and realized that there
might be weeks of continued delirium.</p>

<p>For the next fourteen days Eugenia was
correct in her prognostication. But as
they were a rather dreadful two weeks for
her she would never talk of them freely
afterwards. All that time she had but faint
hope that the young soldier would live,
and except for her patient and Duke she
was completely alone.</p>

<p>However, Eugenia managed to get the
young fellow upstairs and into Barbara’s
former blue bedroom, although he was never
conscious of the change.</p>

<p>She was compelled to do this, or else
have her patient discovered. For she was
not to remain entirely undisturbed while
the victorious German soldiers overran the
entire neighborhood.</p>

<p>One afternoon, three days after their installation,
when fortunately she chanced to
be working in her kitchen, a tremendous
knocking sounded upon the blue front door.
Immediately Eugenia conceived that it was<span class="pagenum">[222]</span>
some one sent to inquire why a solitary
female should remain sequestered in a
house, when supplies and houses were so
much needed for the German soldiers.</p>

<p>A satisfactory explanation would doubtless
be difficult; nevertheless Eugenia, with
a blue check gingham apron over her nursing
one and a cup and saucer and dish towel
in her hands, opened the front door.</p>

<p>There was something which she hoped
looked “old maidy” in this suggestion of
dishes and tea. Nothing to suggest the
concealment of a young French officer!</p>

<p>Outside her door Eugenia encountered a
stiff German youth in an immaculate uniform,
bearing an official letter. The letter
commanded Eugenia to report to the officer
in authority in the nearest village. She
was to explain her presence in the neighborhood,
her occupation, and above all
offer proof of her nationality.</p>

<p>Therefore, before setting out the next
morning Eugenia changed the quarters of
her patient. There could be little doubt
that some one would be sent to investigate
the interior of the little “Farmhouse with<span class="pagenum">[223]</span>
the Blue Front Door.” One could scarcely
expect to keep a soldier hidden in the only
room of any size in the house.</p>

<p>Fortunately Barbara’s room was the
most inconspicuous of the four bedrooms.
Besides, Eugenia had a certain scheme in
mind which she hoped might help when the
critical moment arrived.</p>

<p>Naturally Eugenia had passports and
certificates to identify herself as an American
Red Cross nurse. But she also took
with her to the colonel of the German regiment
another paper of a different character.
However, she did not mean to show
this before feeling her way very carefully.
The paper was a check for a large sum of
money on an American bank in Boston and
signed with her own name.</p>

<p>At the improvised office of the German
colonel, Eugenia told her story as briefly as
possible. Moreover, she told the exact
truth in regard to herself in every detail up
to a certain moment. This was the moment
when she awakened to consciousness
after being struck by a German shell.</p>

<p>There was nothing antagonistic in Eugenia’s<span class="pagenum">[224]</span>
manner with the officer. She explained
to him that the little French farmhouse
had been allotted to the use of the
four American Red Cross nurses and that
the other three girls had retreated with the
French field hospital staff. Then she asked
that she be allowed to remain in their house
until such time as she could communicate
with her friends in America. As she was
alone it would be impossible to have German
soldiers quartered upon her.</p>

<p>At this moment Eugenia put her hand
upon the check in her pocket.</p>

<p>Very frankly she then declared that she
realized it to be each person’s duty to assist
with the shelter and feeding of a victorious
army. But as she was unable to do either
of these things, would not the colonel accept
money instead? She trusted that he would
not be offended by her unusual suggestion,
for it appeared to her the only just and fair
thing to do under the circumstances. Finally
after further discussion and hesitation
and another careful study of her passports,
the German officer agreed to do what Eugenia
had suggested. However, he insisted,<span class="pagenum">[225]</span>
as a matter of necessary formality, that
two German soldiers be sent to her house
next day on a tour of inspection. When
they came Eugenia had the courage to
show them into the very blue bedroom
where the young French officer lay concealed.
But beforehand, and in spite of
her Puritan ancestry, she explained that this
room was her own bedchamber. Moreover,
to prove that she had nothing to
keep secret she had entirely emptied her
closet. Her own clothes, beside all those
that the other three girls had left behind,
were thrown with pretended carelessness on
top the very bed where <a id="Ref_225"></a>Captain Castaigne
lay hidden under a pile of bedclothes.</p>

<p>The young Frenchman was in a stupor
from fever at the time, so Eugenia considered
that there could be little risk of his
either moving or speaking. However, if
risk there was, she felt compelled to take it.</p>

<p>The German soldiers made no effort to
give this special room a thorough investigation.
They merely glanced in, and then,
like the proverbial ten thousand men of
King George’s army, marched out again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[226]</span></p>

<p>After this Eugenia was troubled no further
by intruders from the ranks of the
Allies’ enemy. Her next visitor was of a
much more unexpected character.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<span class="cheaderfont"><em>Out of the Depth</em></span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">All one night Eugenia feared that Captain
Castaigne would die.</p>

<p>This was the fourteenth night
after the beginning of his fever and a crisis
in the disease. So for twenty-four hours
she did not have one-half hour of uninterrupted
sleep. It was not because the
young man needed her constant care, for
indeed he was never conscious of her existence.
When he called it was always to
ask for some one else, and yet it was always
Eugenia who answered. Then for a little
while at least the patient would seem to be
satisfied.</p>

<p>But if at their first accidental meeting
in Paris the four American Red Cross girls
had considered Captain Castaigne absurdly
young for his captain’s commission, what
must they have thought of him now? To
Eugenia he appeared like a boy of sixteen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[228]</span></p>

<p>It is true that he had a tiny dark moustache,
but except for this his face remained
smooth. Then his nurse had been compelled
to cut off all his dark hair in order to
cool his head, and his slender body had
become wasted and his eyes sunken. Indeed,
the features, which Eugenia had once
considered too perfect for a man’s, now
frequently made her think of a delicate
cameo, when he lay with his face in profile
against the pure white of his pillow.</p>

<p>Watching him on this night, which she
feared might be his last, Eugenia felt
unusually moved.</p>

<p>After all, he must have been a brave and
capable fellow to have received his present
rank in the French army while still so young.
Moreover, there was a possibility that Captain
Castaigne had more force of character
than she had ever given him credit for.
Had he not rebelled against his mother’s
ideas of rank and dignity, and in spite of
his devotion to her refused to keep his title
in a country which was now a republic?
Of course, Eugenia could not believe that
the young man really had the true democratic<span class="pagenum">[229]</span>
spirit in which she so thoroughly
trusted. Still there was a chance that he
might not be so futile a character as she
had first supposed.</p>

<p>Leaning over to wipe her patient’s face
with a damp cloth, Eugenia made up her
mind to one thing. If Captain Castaigne
died she would go at once to the German
colonel in command of the French village
and confess what she had done. Of necessity
she must be punished for her falsehood
and treachery, but surely she would be permitted
to send for the Countess Amélie at
the last. The young French officer could
be of no interest to his enemies after his
death.</p>

<p>But where the Countess could be hiding,
nor whom she could find to send for her,
Eugenia had not the faintest idea. For
these past two weeks she had been so entirely
shut away from the outside world.
Except for her one visit to the German
colonel she had never left the little “House
with the Blue Front Door” since the night
she first brought her patient into it. Nor
had Eugenia received a single line from<span class="pagenum">[230]</span>
any one of the other three Red Cross girls
to afford her the faintest idea of what could
have become of them. But she did not
worry so much as she might have done at a
time when she was less occupied. Besides,
naturally she believed that the three girls
were with the French field hospital at some
point back of the line of the French army’s
retreat.</p>

<p>Toward dawn Eugenia knew that the
hour of greatest danger to her patient would
arrive. For it is an acknowledged scientific
fact that life is at its lowest ebb with
the rising and the setting of the sun.</p>

<p>Therefore, just before this time Eugenia
left her patient’s bedside and went into the
room adjoining, which she used for her own
needs. There she washed her face and
hands in cold water and, letting down her
heavy hair, plaited it in two braids. She
was very tired and yet must prepare herself
to meet the coming hour with all the
strength and wisdom she could muster.</p>

<p>Even as she made her toilet she was
aware of the feverish muttering of the
young officer. His stupor had passed<span class="pagenum">[231]</span>
several days before, but since his nurse
could not decide whether his weak restlessness
and almost incessant crying out were
not worse symptoms. Certainly they were
more trying upon her nerves.</p>

<p>“Ma mère, ma mère,” he was repeating
his mother’s name over and over again, as
if he must see her again before his spirit
could leave his body.</p>

<p>Eugenia slipped back and for the hundredth
time laid her hand gently on the
young fellow’s brow. Somehow he must
be quieted, comforted into thinking his
mother near him. Then if he never returned
to consciousness he would pass out
of the world’s alarms with a sense of her
presence.</p>

<p>Do you recall that Barbara Meade had
discovered a wonderful, healing quality
in the touch of Eugenia’s hands? It is
true that a few people have this vital,
health-giving quality in their hands, which
is not true of others.</p>

<p>Anyhow, Eugenia’s patient grew quieter,
although he still murmured a broken word
now and then. He was strangely pathetic,<span class="pagenum">[232]</span>
because, however much he might move his
arms and the upper part of his body, his
legs remained lifeless. For now and then
when he had endeavored to change his
position the pain had been so great as to
pierce through his stupor.</p>

<p>“Mon fils, mon fils,” Eugenia whispered
several times. It was all the French she
dared permit herself to speak, and yet the
simple words “my son,” even spoken by a
New England old maid, carried their magic.</p>

<p>Yet Eugenia was looking little like an old
maid as she leaned over the French boy&mdash;and
he was scarcely more than a boy. She
wore the violet wrapper, and as she kneeled
her long dark braids of hair lay upon the
floor. She too had grown thin and white
from her two weeks’ vigil of nursing, cooking,
taking entire charge of her patient,
herself and the little house. Nevertheless,
Eugenia’s face had for some reason
softened, perhaps because she was too
weary and too selfless in her devotion to
her patient to feel superior to any earthly
thing. At this moment her eyes were both
sad and hopeful, while her lashes looked<span class="pagenum">[233]</span>
longer and darker than usual against the
pallor of her cheeks.</p>

<p>Finally Captain Castaigne moved away
from the soft pressure of his nurse’s hands.
As he moved with more strength than Eugenia
believed him to possess, for the next
instant she watched him even more closely.</p>

<p>He was muttering a number of confused
phrases, now and then what sounded like
a command to his soldiers. Then all at
once he stopped and laughed a little foolishly.</p>

<p>“Eugenia Peabody,” he pronounced the
words distinctly, although with a French
accent which made the name more attractive
than it ever had before. “Eugenié
Paybodé” was the way it sounded to its
possessor.</p>

<p>Eugenia stared more closely. Could
Captain Castaigne know her once again?
Since the first night after his injury he never
seemed to have been aware of her identity.</p>

<p>A further glance into his eyes showed
this was not true. There was no sign of
intelligence there, only vagueness and a
confused groping in the dark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[234]</span></p>

<p>“Mademoiselle Paybodé, she is what
you call in English ‘an old maid.’”</p>

<p>Then the young officer laughed boyishly,
as if he and a friend had been discussing a
new acquaintance and found the subject
amusing.</p>

<p>Eugenia flushed. It was absurd, but for
the moment she felt hurt and angry. Few
of us like to be the subject of a joke and
Eugenia was not gifted with much sense of
humor. But a little later she had the grace
to be ashamed of herself. However she
might dislike the young Frenchman whom
she had been nursing so faithfully, she must
remember that he had unfailing good manners.
Their one unfortunate meeting had
been due to a mistake on his part. Afterwards
he had done all that he could to
make amends. Certainly he would be the
last person to be rude to her under the
present circumstances if he had known
what he was saying! Moreover, the minute
after he continued talking at random
upon subjects which had no possible connection.</p>

<p>Soon after, glancing at her watch, Eugenia<span class="pagenum">[235]</span>
got up and crossed the room. The
next instant she returned in order to take
her patient’s temperature. His fever was
not so high, but then his pulse and heart
seemed to be growing dangerously weaker.
Giving him the necessary stimulant, she
again stood by his bedside, watching and
waiting.</p>

<p>Captain Castaigne was no longer talking
in his delirium. He had grown quieter and
was staring, yet with an unseeing expression,
at the ceiling overhead. At this moment
Eugenia discovered that the dawn had
come at last. A shaft of yellow light had
entered the high window and shone across
the wounded officer’s face. It gave him
such a curiously transfigured look that for
an instant Eugenia was frightened. But the
next, realizing what had occurred, she
walked across to the window and stood
looking out at the country.</p>

<p>The morning wind blew across her face.
The dawn was a cold December one and
yet the air was grateful. A little later
Duke came and thrust his great head into
Eugenia’s hand. Until this moment he had<span class="pagenum">[236]</span>
not left his place by his master’s bedside
since twilight the day before. But now he
too seemed to feel that there was nothing
more love or vigilance could do. One must
simply wait.</p>

<p>The landscape was particularly lovely
this morning, Eugenia thought. A white
frost lay upon the meadows and trees like a
veil, and one could not see the devastation
that the recent fighting must have brought
upon the countryside. Eugenia had the
right to feel rather like a prisoner, and yet
she was not at this time conscious of herself.
She was wondering how the Countess
Amélie could live when she learned that her
only son had fallen a victim to the enemy
who had despoiled her land and captured
her home. She was an old woman and this
would be too full a measure of sorrow.</p>

<p>How long Eugenia stood at the window
she did not know. It could scarcely have
been more than a few moments, yet when
she turned around she was not aware of
what had influenced her. Perhaps it was
Duke’s desertion, for once more he had
marched over to his master’s side. Here,<span class="pagenum">[237]</span>
he stood sentinel with his eyes fixed on
the young captain’s face. He no longer
crouched upon the floor as he had been
doing for the past twelve hours.</p>

<p>Straightway Eugenia experienced a sudden
rushing of warm blood to her own
cheeks and a flooding sense of happiness
and warmth.</p>

<p>For Captain Castaigne was looking at her
gravely, yet with entire recognition.</p>

<p>“I have come back to fight once more for
France because of you,” he whispered.
Then, in spite of his exhaustion, he tried
gallantly to lift Eugenia’s fingers to his
lips. But finding himself too weak, he
simply lay still and smiled at her.</p>

<p>Utterly ridiculous in a self-possessed person
like Eugenia! But because she felt a
sudden overpowering inclination to burst
into tears of relief at her patient’s safety,
she frowned upon him sternly instead.</p>

<p>“You are not to stir or speak until I return,”
she announced severely, and then
deliberately left the room. Of course, she
intended to get some simple nourishment
for the young officer at once, but this was<span class="pagenum">[238]</span>
not the important reason for her withdrawal.
Certainly Eugenia did not so far
intend to forget her dignity as a nurse as to
show emotion!</p>

<p>At about noon on the same day Eugenia
was cheerfully working downstairs in the
little French kitchen, while Captain Castaigne
was sleeping quietly upstairs with
the door open so that she could hear his
faintest move.</p>

<p>For the kitchen had to be seriously considered.
The supply of food necessary for
an invalid was growing dangerously low in
their larder, and for the next few weeks the
wounded soldier must have proper nutriment.
After an hour’s investigation Eugenia
decided that she must go to the village
and see what could be done. It would be
difficult to leave her patient alone, but his
life was no longer in danger. Time would
bring healing, if nothing of an unexpected
nature occurred.</p>

<p>Then Eugenia heard a gentle tapping at
her kitchen door. It was much the same
noise that François had been accustomed to
make on his daily visits with supplies from<span class="pagenum">[239]</span>
the chateau. For a moment Eugenia hoped
that François might have come unexpectedly
to their aid. But on opening the door,
she found a wholly unexpected visitor.</p>

<p>A young girl of about sixteen stood outside.
At first Eugenia did not recognize
her. Then she saw that she wore a torn
skirt and a little scarlet cap and that she was
singularly pretty and graceful.</p>

<p>Like a flash a picture came before her;
it was the figure of a little girl dancing before
a group of French soldiers. What was
the name Barbara had afterwards called
her, the name of some character in an old
French romance?</p>

<p>“Nicolete,” Eugenia said suddenly. And
drawing the girl inside the little kitchen,
she carefully closed the outside door.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />
<span class="cheaderfont"><em>Eugenia</em></span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">This year in the southern portion of
France it was March, not May, that
came singing over the land. The
days were soft and serene with the warmth
and sunshine of late spring.</p>

<p>In front of the Chateau d’Amélie a peacock
walked slowly across the lawn, spreading
his tail and then arching his neck in an
effort to behold his own grandeur. Near
him two girls were walking up and down
with a young man dressed in the uniform of
a British officer. Not far away in a somewhat
neglected garden a French peasant
woman was laying a cloth on a wooden
table and setting out cups and saucers of
fine old china. It was self-evident that an
afternoon meal of some kind was in preparation
and that the two girls and young
man were waiting for it to be made ready,
and perhaps for other guests as well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[241]</span></p>

<p>This was all taking place in the very
neighborhood which a few months before
had been overrun by the German troops
after the retreat of the French army. But
the French had returned unto their own
again, at least in this particular vicinity
where the Chateau d’Amélie had stood for
several centuries. Six weeks after their
retreat before the superior forces of the
German enemy, the French had retaken
their deserted trenches, after driving the
enemy out of the neighborhood. More than
this, they had afterwards forced the Germans
to retire a quarter of a mile further
back beyond the borders of Alsace-Lorraine.</p>

<p>Therefore happiness, or at least a degree
of it, reigned once more in this portion of
France, and in no place perhaps was there
a fuller share than in the Chateau d’Amélie.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose has become of
Captain Castaigne? He promised to join
us at four o’clock,” one of the girls inquired
carelessly.</p>

<p>Before her question could be answered a
wheeled chair appeared at one side of the<span class="pagenum">[242]</span>
garden with a young man seated in it. His
face and figure suggested a semi-invalid,
but his costume revealed extreme care and
elegance. Moreover, his expression was
radiant.</p>

<p>“Mes amis, you are more than welcome,”
he cried, speaking a rather absurd mixture
of French and English. Then turning to
the little old man at the back of his chair he
urged him to hurry, until the chair, its driver
and rider, fairly rollicked over the uneven
lawn.</p>

<p>There Captain Castaigne gravely shook
hands with his guests, Nona Davis and
Barbara Meade, who had just come to the
chateau from the little “Farmhouse with
the Blue Front Door.” Afterwards he
smiled at his friend Lieutenant Robert
Hume, who was at present a visitor in his
house.</p>

<p>“Mother will be here in a moment,” he
explained. “She has asked me to beg her
adored American girl friends to wait a few
moments until she is able to be with them.
The truth is, Madame la Comtesse is at
present engaged in making <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit gateaux</i>&mdash;little<span class="pagenum">[243]</span>
cakes, I believe you say. She would
not trust the peasant Emma with so delicate
a commission. But where is Mademoiselle
Paybodé? Surely she has not forgotten
her promise!”</p>

<p>Captain Castaigne’s face had suddenly
changed; he seemed to be both annoyed
and disappointed. So as usual Barbara
spoke impulsively without thinking beforehand.</p>

<p>“Oh, Eugenia is so tiresome!” she began
with a little stamp of her foot. “Nona
and I thought all along up until the very
last minute that she was coming with us
this afternoon. Then she insisted that she
had a slight headache and had best rest and
read so it would not grow worse. The
truth is, I don’t believe she wanted to
come. Besides, she had the audacity to
announce that she thought we would have
a better time without her.”</p>

<p>Then Barbara ceased her confession,
conscious that Nona was frowning upon
her and that it was scarcely good manners
to have spoken so freely. When would
she ever get over her dreadful western
candor?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[244]</span></p>

<p>“I am sure Barbara is mistaken in at
least a portion of her tirade,” Nona interrupted.
“Eugenia did have a headache
or else she could not have failed to wish to
spend the afternoon with Madame Castaigne.
Really, I don’t think Eugenia is
very well, although she will not admit it.
But since we came back to the farmhouse
she has never been just the same. She
does not do half such hard nursing as she
once did and yet she is often tired and
unlike herself. I expect&mdash;&mdash;” Then Nona
stopped talking and laughed, for she had
discovered Barbara smiling upon her with
wicked satisfaction. Having broken into
the conversation to stem the flood of Barbara’s
tactlessness, she had now plunged
in even deeper than her friend.</p>

<p>There was no one, however, to save her
from the results of her stupidity, for Henri
Castaigne had flushed and looked miserably
uncomfortable as soon as she spoke.</p>

<p>“There is small wonder that Miss Paybodé
is not so strong as she once was.
When I think of all that she went through
in those miserable weeks with me, I cannot<span class="pagenum">[245]</span>
see how she endured it. It must have
killed any one else. Then there was the
secrecy and the long concealment even
when I had sufficiently recovered to have
been made a prisoner by the enemy. Such
strength, such courage! Mon Dieu, how
shall I ever repay her?”</p>

<p>The young French officer looked so unnecessarily
tragic that to save the situation
his three friends laughed.</p>

<p>“Oh, goodness, you don’t have to repay
Eugenia! I am sure she really loved taking
care of you,” Barbara interposed. “Besides,
I expect she bullied you abominably.
She adores bossing people. But there is
my Countess, I know she wishes to speak
to me first, since I’m sure she likes me
best. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Au revoir.</i>” And Barbara ran off in
the direction of the garden, where the figure
of the Countess Amélie had just appeared,
leaving her three companions to follow.</p>

<p>Nona then walked along by one side of
Captain Castaigne’s chair, with Lieutenant
Hume on the other, while old François
pushed nobly in the rear.</p>

<p>The French officer made no effort to hide<span class="pagenum">[246]</span>
his annoyance at Barbara’s frankness. He
was still weak and sometimes a little querulous
after his long illness.</p>

<p>“Miss Meade does not understand, she
does not appreciate Miss Paybodé,” he
began. “Even my mother, although she is
on her knees to my friend because of her
great kindness to me, even she cannot see
all that Eugenié has been, all that she
is&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>This appeared to be a conversation of
unfinished sentences, of things better left
unsaid, for Captain Castaigne now looked
as if he would give a great deal to have
kept his last remark to himself.</p>

<p>However, Nona Davis had the exquisite
tact of many southern girls and apparently
had heard only the first part of her host’s
speech.</p>

<p>“Oh, you must not misunderstand Barbara
and Eugenia,” she explained. “Most
of the time they disagree on every subject.
But the truth is they are really tremendously
fond of each other. Why, now that
Mildred Thornton is in Paris with her
brother Dick, I feel quite left out. Barbara<span class="pagenum">[247]</span>
used to weep for Eugenia every night
after we made our escape with your mother
and François through the passage under
the chateau. You see when we learned
that she was not with Mildred, but had
been left behind, naturally we supposed
that something dreadful had happened to
her. And of course Barbara understood
how self-sacrificing Eugenia always is and
feared she had given her life for some one
else. If you only knew how happy we all
were when we finally learned that you were
both alive and that Eugenia was caring for
you!”</p>

<p>“But how did you hear?” Lieutenant
Hume demanded. The little party had
now almost reached the garden where the
table was spread for their entertainment,
so there was but little time for Nona’s
story.</p>

<p>“Oh, we heard through a little French
girl, Nicolete. You see, she came to the
farmhouse one day to see Eugenia, and
after they had talked a while Eugenia discovered
that she was a friend of Captain
Castaigne’s. Then she told her that he<span class="pagenum">[248]</span>
was in hiding. After that Nicolete used
to come every day and bring supplies and
seemed devoted to Eugenia. Well, you
remember Madame told you how François
finally made his way back to this neighborhood
to try and find out what had become
of Captain Castaigne. You see the Countess
was in despair, as naturally we all
believed that Captain Castaigne had been
killed or taken prisoner, but François would
not give up. He was unkindly treated by
the Germans when he first came home,
but afterwards they allowed him to work
for them. Then of course he saw Nicolete
and she told him what had happened. So
we actually knew where Eugenia and Captain
Castaigne were before we were able
to get back here. But you can imagine
how anxious we used to feel for fear they
would be discovered and something dreadful
done to both of them!”</p>

<p>“It is a perfectly ripping story,” Lieutenant
Hume answered convincingly. But
he added nothing more, as Madame Castaigne
at this moment came forward to
greet Nona. Actually the old French lady<span class="pagenum">[249]</span>
put both her hands on Nona’s cheeks and
kissed her daintily on the lips. For the
two young American girls had become her
devoted friends and admirers during the
weeks they spent together after their escape
from the chateau.</p>

<p>An hour later they were still sitting talking
cheerfully together in the old French
garden. Only their host had disappeared.
Captain Castaigne had asked to be excused,
and as he was still an invalid no one thought
seriously of his departure. Presumably he
had retired to his own apartments to rest.
But the young French officer had not felt
like going indoors, although he was not
in the mood for further conversation. As
it was still early in the afternoon he had
asked François to wheel his chair down
into the woods which lay between the
chateau and the little “Farmhouse with
the Blue Front Door.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />
<span class="cheaderfont"><em>The Pool of Truth</em></span></h2>


<p class="dropcap">There by the pool on a log with a
book in her lap sat Eugenia. She
was not reading, however, although
her book lay open. At the sound of
Captain Castaigne’s chair approaching she
looked toward him.</p>

<p>The young man’s expression was severe
on this occasion, not Eugenia’s.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to intrude upon you,” he
began stiffly. “Your friends told me that
you were suffering from a headache; naturally
I did not expect to find you here.”</p>

<p>In response Eugenia smiled good-naturedly,
just as one might to a fretful
child. She had gotten up at once and now
came forward and took the young man’s
hand.</p>

<p>“I did have a headache, Captain Castaigne.
I am too good a Puritan to have
told a complete story. But while I did not<span class="pagenum">[251]</span>
feel well enough to see and talk to a number
of persons, I did not desire to go to
bed, where Barbara was pleased to send me
by way of punishment. Besides, I knew
your mother would prefer to have the two
girls to herself. I really think she misses
them now that they can see so little of each
other. But why talk about me? You are
stronger every day, aren’t you? Can’t
you walk with your crutches if François
is near? Come, won’t you try now? I
am sure I can catch you if you are too much
for François.”</p>

<p>Two spots of angry color appeared in
Captain Castaigne’s cheeks.</p>

<p>“I am through with your support, Miss
Paybodé,” he returned curtly. “When
I choose to walk I prefer not to be held up
by a woman.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” Eugenia answered, and stared at
her former patient helplessly. What had
she said or done to make him so angry?</p>

<p>But the next instant the young officer
had taken her hand and in French fashion
touched it with his lips.</p>

<p>“Forgive me,” he said, “I am impossible.<span class="pagenum">[252]</span>
This, after I depended on you so long for
every care. If you will be so good, I think
I should like to sit there on the log where
you were sitting.”</p>

<p>During his illness Eugenia had grown
so accustomed to these swift changes of
mood in her patient that she paid no
especial attention to this one. Instead she
helped him out of his chair and kept at his
side while he hobbled over to the log she
had just deserted.</p>

<p>But when she stood above him looking
down upon him with pride and satisfaction
over his achievement he grew angry again.</p>

<p>“If you cannot sit beside me I have no
idea of taking your place,” he protested.</p>

<p>The next instant Eugenia sank meekly
down. It rather amused her to have Captain
Castaigne treat her in this fashion.</p>

<p>Just before them was the small lake
which Nona and Barbara had discovered
the first morning after their arrival at the
farmhouse. It was shadowy now with the
coming of evening, but still the water was
coolly clear. Its beauty soothed one to
silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[253]</span></p>

<p>It was Eugenia who spoke first.</p>

<p>“I am glad to have this moment here
with you, Captain Castaigne,” she began,
with a return to her former manner. “Because
I wish to tell you and have you explain
to your mother that Nona and Barbara
and I may be leaving this part of the
country in a little while. The truth is, our
services as nurses are not needed here as
they were some months ago. There is
little fighting going on and several new
French nurses came down from Paris the
other day. Besides this, Mrs. Thornton
and Judge Thornton have grown very nervous
and unhappy over Mildred, as well as
the rest of us, in the last few weeks. They
have both written to urge me to persuade
the other girls to join me and go into Belgium
to help with the relief work there.
You are almost well now, so I shall be able
to say good-by with much greater satisfaction.”</p>

<p>This last speech Eugenia made in a
gracious tone and yet her companion received
it ungraciously. And this in spite
of the fact that his manner was usually
charming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[254]</span></p>

<p>“There is no time when you would not
say good-by to me with satisfaction, Miss
Paybodé,” he returned. “However, if I
am spared perhaps I may some day show
my appreciation of your great kindness.
I have written my colonel to say that I
shall be able to rejoin my command in
another week or ten days. I have wasted
much valuable time with two illnesses.
Perhaps the third may be my lucky one!”
he finished, casting his dark eyes upward
with dramatic intensity.</p>

<p>In reply Eugenia actually patted his
knee in a comforting, motherly fashion.</p>

<p>“Don’t be absurd. You cannot return
to your command for two or three months
at least,” she admonished.</p>

<p>“Two or three weeks shall be the limit
to my patience,” her companion repeated,
still talking like a sulky boy.</p>

<p>Eugenia frowned. “I shall speak to
your mother. She will never allow it.”
Again her manner was that of a New England
school teacher. Nevertheless Captain
Castaigne did not smile. Yet he
seemed to have forgotten his age and dignity<span class="pagenum">[255]</span>
as well as rank in the army, for you
see he had been a good many weeks under
Eugenia’s discipline.</p>

<p>“The day you go to Belgium I shall
return to my post,” he muttered.</p>

<p>Eugenia would like to have shaken him.
Had he been in the little “Farmhouse with
the Blue Front Door,” she would simply
have gotten up at this instant and left her
patient until he had learned to behave
himself. But at present the circumstances
were different, and besides she might not
have a chance to talk to him again. So
somehow he must be made to behave
sensibly.</p>

<p>“You will do no such thing. You owe
more than that to me,” Eugenia protested
unexpectedly. A few moments before she
would not have believed that any earthly
thing could have forced her to mention,
either to Captain Castaigne or to any one
else, the sacrifices which she had made for
him. But now she had spoken deliberately
and meaning exactly what she said.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the young French officer
did not answer immediately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[256]</span></p>

<p>“Eugenié,” he said finally, and the querulous,
boyish note in his voice had quite
gone, “you must listen to me. I have
been talking like a child, but I am scarcely
surprised at myself, since you have always
insisted upon treating me as scarcely more
than a child. I have borne with it because
I have been ill and you have known me
only in that condition. But, Eugenié, I
will endure it no longer.”</p>

<p>The young man’s voice held a quietly
determined quality. He was perfectly
courteous and yet his listener understood
at this instant why he was considered one
of the most forceful as well as one of the
most popular of the younger officers in the
French service.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Eugenia scarcely knew how
or what to reply.</p>

<p>“I am so sorry, Captain Castaigne,” she
answered. “I have not intended to fail in
respect to you. But perhaps I have unintentionally
presumed on your long weakness
and dependence upon me.”</p>

<p>And this from Eugenia! Moreover, her
face had flushed and she could not lift her<span class="pagenum">[257]</span>
lids because of the tears in her eyes. Yet
she was not really angry with Captain
Castaigne.</p>

<p>The next time he spoke his voice was
once more gentle and he even managed
to smile.</p>

<p>“You know that is not what I mean
in the least. It is absurd of you to
talk of showing proper respect to me,
Eugenié, as if I were your commanding
officer. Surely you understand that when
a man cares for a woman as I do for you,
there is but one thing possible between
them. They must love each other fully
and equally. I know you have nothing
but a kindly feeling for me, but you shall
not go away, when I may never see you
again, without hearing the truth.”</p>

<p>Still Eugenia did not understand! Nevertheless
her face grew pale instead of flushed
and her dark eyes gazed into her companion’s
almost curiously.</p>

<p>Yet the next moment, when Captain
Castaigne touched her hand with infinite
gentleness and respect, she drew it coldly
away from him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[258]</span></p>

<p>“I quite understand your gratitude, Captain
Castaigne. But please appreciate the
fact that it is unnecessary for you to go this
far to express your obligation. I have
only done for you what I would have done
for any one in the world under the same
circumstances.”</p>

<p>“I am entirely aware of that fact,” the
young officer answered curtly.</p>

<p>Then he and Eugenia both maintained
a dignified silence for the space of sixty
seconds.</p>

<p>By this time the girl rose up.</p>

<p>“This is our good-by, perhaps. We
may not see each other alone again. You
must forgive me if I seem to be cold and
unfeeling. Of course, I should have cared
for any one just as I cared for you. But
I should not have been so glad to have been
given the opportunity had my patient been
any other person.” Eugenia was trying
her best to cast aside the cold and formal
manner which had made her misunderstood
all the days of her life. In her earnestness
somehow she looked younger and humbler
than usual. Indeed, she was a very fair<span class="pagenum">[259]</span>
and lovely woman standing there with her
hands clasped before her. Her eyes were
shining with the sincerity of her emotion,
while her attitude expressed a strange
mixture of dignity and appeal.</p>

<p>“When we first met each other, Captain
Castaigne, I confess I had a wrong idea of
you. Now I feel that I could have rendered
France no greater service than to have
saved your life. Since I came abroad to
nurse in order to help the little I am able,
perhaps my coming has not been in vain.
Good-by.”</p>

<p>She was moving away, when the young
officer reached out and took hold of her
skirt.</p>

<p>“Please don’t go for another moment,”
he pleaded. “Of course I understand that
so noble a woman cannot love a man who
has so little to offer as I have. Why, in
spite of all our lands, my mother and I are
little more than paupers! And if I am
spared when this war is over, perhaps I
shall always be lame.”</p>

<p>The girl was standing looking down at
the young fellow whose head was slightly<span class="pagenum">[260]</span>
bowed, when instinctively she laid her firm,
beautiful hand on his head with unconscious
sympathy and tenderness. She had
done the same thing so many times before
during his illness. But Eugenia’s hand
now trembled a little, for she was slowly
beginning to appreciate what Captain Castaigne
had been trying to say to her.</p>

<p>Curious, for Eugenia to think first that
she had never received a proposal before
in her life, or she might have known better
how to receive it. Then her next sensation
was an odd combination of gratitude
and protest.</p>

<p>“I have been very stupid, Captain Castaigne,
and you have been very good,”
she answered. “But even if you believe
what you have just said to me, and of
course I know that you would not deceive
me, you yourself must realize that nothing
but friendship can ever exist between us.
I am several years older than you, and I
have no delusions about my own attractions.
You are young and brilliant, but
then I need not enumerate your gifts,” the
girl added, smiling with a kind of gentle<span class="pagenum">[261]</span>
humorousness she had never possessed before.
“All this is merely gratitude you feel
toward me, and a little affection because of
my care of you. Six months from now I
shall be only a memory.”</p>

<p>“Then you <em>do not</em> love me?” Captain
Castaigne inquired bluntly. He it was who
had now cast aside all his soft graciousness
of manner, the delicate evasions of the direct
truth, that sometimes constitute what
is known as a charming manner. It was
Eugenia who, in spite of her Puritan faith
and training, was refusing to meet the
issue fairly.</p>

<p>She hesitated because the truth overwhelmed
her. The idea of caring for
Captain Castaigne except as a friend had
never for a single instant before occurred
to her. Of course, he had filled her life and
thoughts for many weeks, but that was
because of the peculiar situation into which
they had been forced by circumstances.
Moreover, the thought of their never meeting
again had given her a sense of loss and
emptiness. Yet Eugenia stuck by her
colors gallantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[262]</span></p>

<p>“That is not the important question,
Captain Castaigne, and I cannot answer
you. For always there would remain an
impossible gulf between us. There is your
position, your mother’s disappointment,
our different ways of looking at life. Why,
you would soon become dreadfully ashamed
of a New England old maid endeavoring to
turn herself into a charming young wife.”</p>

<p>Eugenia glanced into the little pool of
water near by, shadowed by the trees.
“Nona has been calling this tiny lake
‘The Pool of Melisande,’ Captain Castaigne,
but to me it is a mirror of truth,
in which I can see myself only too plainly.
It is growing late and you must not be
out in the cold air. Please let me call
François and have him take you home.”</p>

<p>Receiving no reply but a quiet look of
determination, Eugenia summoned the old
man. Then she assisted François to get the
young officer back into his wheeled chair
and afterwards stood watching them until
they had both disappeared.</p>

<p>Then, as it was almost twilight, Eugenia
turned and began to walk slowly toward<span class="pagenum">[263]</span>
the little French farmhouse. She realized
that she had just deliberately turned her
back upon the fairest opportunity life
might ever offer her. Nevertheless, both
her conscience and her brain approved her
action.</p>

<p>“There is only one thing which I might
have confided and did not,” Eugenia murmured
reflectively. “Perhaps I should
have explained that it would not matter in
the least that Henri and his mother have
no money. I have more than enough for
us all.” Then as she drew nearer home:
“Never mind, Captain Castaigne will soon
have forgotten what he has just said to me.
But perhaps it is just as well that we are
soon to go into Belgium to help with the
Red Cross work there, for I may not find
it quite so easy to forget.”</p>

<p>When she reached home it was dark.
But as the other girls had not yet returned
from the chateau, Eugenia went upstairs
to her own room without making a light.
There she flung herself down upon the bed,
remembering gratefully that because she
had a headache, she might reasonably be<span class="pagenum">[264]</span>
allowed to spend the evening alone. Then
Barbara would have no chance to ask
questions.</p>

<p>The third volume in the American Girls’
Red Cross series is to be known as “The
Red Cross Girls in Belgium.” In this story
the four girls will be at work in an even
more tragically interesting land. Here
their adventures and their romances will
continue and one of the girls at least shall
find what is at once the end and the beginning
of a girl’s career.</p>

<p>The book will also deal with conditions
in Belgium at the present time and show
how the people of the United States have
brought aid and relief to a suffering nation.</p>
